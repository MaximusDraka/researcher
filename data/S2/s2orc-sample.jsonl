activity\nDolphins alter their behavior and movement in response to human coastal activities (e.g., commercial shipping, dredging, ecotourism).The Port of Corpus Christi, Texas, is the largest port in the USA based on total revenue tonnage, yet little research has been conducted on the local bottlenose dolphins since the 1980s, prior to major oil exportation and infrastructure growth.The behavior and movement patterns of dolphins in the presence and absence of vessels were recorded using a shore-based digital theodolite and analyzed using multinomial logistic regression and generalized additive models.Dolphins frequently foraged, traveled, socialized, and milled in the Corpus Christi Ship Channel despite the presence of one or more vessels within 300 m of dolphins during 80% of observations.Dolphin behavior and movement patterns were significantly affected by season, time of day, group composition, and vessel characteristics.Dolphins appear to remain in the active Texas ship channel despite high vessel traffic.The observed dolphin-vessel interactions emphasize the need for long-term monitoring of dolphins near human activities and enforced boating regulations near important marine mammal habitats.\n\nIntroduction\n\nA multitude of anthropogenic activities in coastal environments (e.g., dredging, commercial fishing, recreational boating, tourism, commercial shipping) can alter marine mammal behavior and movement patterns [1][2][3].Vessel activity poses various risks to marine mammals including short-term behavioral disruptions that reduce foraging or resting, long-term shifts in behavior that change social structure and habitat use, and collisions resulting in physical injury or death [4][5][6].Dredging operations, tourism and recreational vessels, and the presence of many large vessels in major shipping ports and marinas contribute to increased vessel traffic and noise pollution that can change dolphin distribution and behavioral patterns [7][8][9].Knowledge of how vessel activity impacts marine mammals is crucial as human populations continue to increase along the coast and modify marine environments [10][11][12].Common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus; henceforth \"bottlenose dolphins\") demonstrating high site fidelity to a coastal area may alter their behavior or movement patterns when vessels are present (e.g., approach or avoid a vessel) [3,4,6,[12][13][14][15].\n\nBottlenose dolphin behavioral states can be influenced by the presence of specific types of vessels, sizes of vessels, operational speeds, and distances.When multiple types and sizes of vessels were operating within 500 m of bottlenose dolphins in the Galveston Ship Channel, Texas, the dolphins foraged and socialized infrequently [3].Bottlenose dolphin behavior in the Galveston-Bolivar ferry lane shifted from foraging to predominantly traveling when medium-sized ferries were nearby [16].Tourism and small recreational vessels that did not adhere to regulations altered dolphin behavior and habitat use, indicating a need for proper vessel operation around bottlenose dolphins [6,16].Dolphin-watching tours may repeatedly seek out dolphin groups in coastal areas for lengthy close-up encounters.In Koombana Bay, Western Australia, bottlenose dolphins decreased the duration of foraging, resting, and socializing and increased the duration of traveling, milling, and diving when tourism vessels were present [17].The abundance of bottlenose dolphins declined and groups were small and spread out when tourism boats were present [6,17,18].Compared to large slow-moving vessels, fast-moving vessels increased behavioral interruptions and avoidance responses from bottlenose dolphins [6,15,19,20].When engine-powered vessels were present near Lampedusa Island, Italy, bottlenose dolphins reduced their feeding, resting, and socializing frequencies [15].Milling and resting behavioral states are often sensitive to interruptions from vessels [21].The presence of multiple vessel types and sizes in Doubtful Sound and Milford Sound, New Zealand, reduced the frequencies of socializing and resting behavioral states and resulted in habitat avoidance [14].In South Carolina, bottlenose dolphin group sizes often decreased and behavioral states changed as vessel traffic and proximity increased [19].\n\nProximate encounters with vessels can also affect bottlenose dolphin movement patterns.Vessels moving at rapid speeds with unpredictable movement patterns (e.g., some small recreational vessels) may elicit evasive movements from dolphins to avoid potential vessel strikes [6].The presence and fast approaches of recreational vessels may provoke avoidance responses from bottlenose dolphins, including increased swim speed and bearing changes as well as movement away from approaching vessels [3,4,20,22].In the presence of engine-powered vessels, bottlenose dolphins have increased their dive duration and interbreath intervals, thereby decreasing surface time when the potential for vessel strikes is the highest [4,22].Slow-moving vessels with predictable movement patterns (e.g., medium and large ferries, barges, cargo carriers, and tankers) may have little or no observable disruptive effects on dolphin movement [19].In coastal areas with high anthropogenic disturbances, vessel interactions with bottlenose dolphins need to be monitored for improved management practices of this protected species [23,24].\n\nThe Port of Corpus Christi is the largest port based on total revenue tonnage and the second-largest crude oil exporter in the USA [25].Since a ban prohibiting oil exportation from the USA ended in 2015, the Port of Corpus Christi has had a major influx of large crude oil tankers and cargo carriers [26].The Corpus Christi Ship Channel (CCSC) is situated on the South Texas Coastal Bend and connects the western Gulf of Mexico to the inshore Port of Corpus Christi and Corpus Christi Bay.The CCSC is being dredged to lengthen and deepen the channel to support larger commercial vessels and crude oil carriers [27,28]; however, no active dredging was observed in the study area during data collection.The increasing infrastructure in the CCSC could have detrimental effects on local wildlife and habitats.\n\nVarious vessel types are present in the CCSC throughout the year including recreational (e.g., jet ski, personal), charter, ecotourism, tug, local towing, law enforcement, trawler, ferry, barge, tanker, carrier, and cargo vessels [27].The Port Aransas ferry operates approximately 2-6 ferries daily all year round, continually transporting vehicles across the CCSC [27].Ecotourism vessels routinely navigate across the CCSC for wildlife viewing.Recreational vessels commonly accelerate rapidly through the CCSC between marinas and protected bays, and vessel densities in the channel may change seasonally with increased traffic in summer months, holidays, and school breaks [27].The seasonal and daily activities of watercrafts utilizing the CCSC can affect bottlenose dolphin behavior and movement [29,30].Previous research on common bottlenose dolphins in the CCSC, the only marine mammal species usually found in the area, last occurred in the 1980s, prior to major port growth [29][30][31].Research is needed to understand present-day vessel effects on bottlenose dolphin behavior and movement in the CCSC.An assessment of the current interactions between bottlenose dolphins and vessels will provide insights into local dolphin sustainability as the port continues to grow and address the urgency of protecting marine mammals in areas with high vessel activity.\n\nThe objectives of this study were to: (1) track bottlenose dolphins in the CCSC-Aransas Pass confluence area; and (2) analyze how dolphin behavioral states and movement patterns vary with temporal patterns, group size, vessel characteristics, and numbers of vessels present.The behavioral states and movement patterns of bottlenose dolphins were hypothesized to vary with vessel presence.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nStudy Area\n\nThe Corpus Christi Ship Channel (CCSC, 14.6 m deep), Lydia Ann Channel (LAC, 7.6 m deep), and Aransas Channel (AC, 4.3 m deep) are three dredged channels composed of mud and flake along the South Texas Coastal Bend [27].The three channels converge in the study area between San José Island, Harbor Island, and Mustang Island, and connect to the Gulf of Mexico through the Aransas Pass (27 • 50 42.1 N 97 • 03 29.1 W; Figure 1).Channels connecting inshore and offshore environments can serve as passageways for predators and prey.The confluence area is characterized by hard engineered shorelines of concrete seawalls and granite blocks.Shorelines along the LAC and AC are lined by natural coastal habitats (e.g., sand, rocks, mangroves, seagrass) as they border undeveloped natural environments (Figure 1).The three channels support extensive daily vessel traffic, with high vessel densities and commercial vessel movements in the confluence area [27].The entrance to the Port Aransas boat harbor extends into the confluence area with the Port Aransas ferry lane adjacent (Figure 1).\n\nPort Aransas experiences a diurnal tide pattern with a 0.42 m range [32] and currents that average approximately 2 kn, depending on wind speed and direction [27].Strong currents from all three channels converge in the CCSC-Aransas Pass confluence area and can make small vessel maneuverability difficult.Port Aransas experiences a diurnal tide pattern with a 0.42 m range [32] and currents that average approximately 2 kn, depending on wind speed and direction [27].Strong currents from all three channels converge in the CCSC-Aransas Pass confluence area and can make small vessel maneuverability difficult.\n\n\nSampling Method\n\nBottlenose dolphin behavioral states and movement patterns were recorded using non-invasive techniques from two elevated land-based theodolite stations during all seasons at 6 h intervals between June 2021 and September 2022.No data on bottlenose dolphins in this study were collected from a research vessel.A digital theodolite (Sokkia Model DT5/DT5S) with 30× magnification used two reference positions and a known height above sea level to triangulate the exact location of dolphins and vessels [33] (Figure 1).The theodolite eyepiece height was positioned at 24.3-24.7 m and 7-8 m above sea level for Site 1 and Site 2, respectively (Figure 1).Sampling was prioritized at Site 1 due to its elevated height and closer proximity to the CCSC-Aransas Pass confluence area.To collect geospatial positions of dolphins, the theodolite monocular crosshair was aligned at the waterline on the dolphin when it surfaced.The theodolite was connected to a Dell laptop (Inspiron 3179) with Mysticetus software (version 2021.22) to convert x and y angle measurements into Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates in real-time and store observed dolphin behavioral states, group sizes, and vessel information.Data collection consisted of one theodolite operator and one computer operator, with the theodolite operator remaining the same individual to eliminate inter-observer bias.When searching for bottlenose dolphins, observers scanned the study area vertically from shoreline to shoreline across the CCSC.\n\nBushnell (12 × 50 mm) and Lakwar (10 × 50 mm) binoculars were used to initially observe dolphin behavioral states (forage, travel, social, mill, orient against current, rest; Table 1).Behavioral states were categorized as \"other\" and excluded from analyses when\n\n\nSampling Method\n\nBottlenose dolphin behavioral states and movement patterns were recorded using noninvasive

across the CCSC.\n\nBushnell (12 × 50 mm) and Lakwar (10 × 50 mm) binoculars were used to initially observe dolphin behavioral states (forage, travel, social, mill, orient against current, rest; Table 1).Behavioral states were categorized as \"other\" and excluded from analyses when they were indistinguishable or when several occurred simultaneously.A dolphin group was defined as two or more dolphins engaged in similar behavioral states within approximately 100 m of each other [34].Individuals or groups of dolphins were actively tracked with the theodolite for approximately 40 min every hour, and their positions, group sizes, and behavioral states were recorded.Dolphin groups included adults and calves (echelon swimming position and <2/3 the size of an adult) [35].At the beginning of each survey day, the largest group of dolphins observed were tracked first, then the second largest, and so on.Data were collected approximately every other time the tracked dolphin or majority of the group surfaced to obtain a precise location measurement.When individuals in a group were spread out, the approximate middle of the group was marked, while the position of the middle individual was marked when dolphins were close together in a group.Dolphins were tracked until an individual or group was lost, visibility was restricted from environmental conditions (e.g., sunset, fog, Beaufort state > 3), tracking time exceeded 1 h, or individuals/groups moved beyond the reliable visibility range of the theodolite (>3 km; Figure 1) [36].Travel Steady or rapid movement in one direction [37] Dolphin swimming speed (m/s) and vessel speed (m/s) were automatically calculated in Mysticetus software for each dolphin and vessel position recorded.Swimming speed was calculated by taking the total distance traveled between two consecutive dolphin positions and dividing by the time lapsed for the dolphin to move between the selected positions.Vessel speed was calculated the same way.Dolphins with swimming speeds ≤11 m/s and vessels with travel speeds <25 m/s were included in the analyses, while those with greater speeds were unrealistic and filtered out.The bearing of a dolphin position is the angle between a meridian on Earth and the line connecting two consecutive dolphin points [41].The bearing (degrees) was calculated based on the great-circle arc using the two consecutive geographic coordinates from the same group of dolphins.Change in bearing, the absolute value in degrees bound by 0 and 180, was calculated post hoc by subtracting one bearing from the preceding bearing based on 3 consecutive geographic coordinates from the same group of dolphins.Larger or greater bearing changes constituted large changes in swim direction or less linear swim paths, while smaller or minimal bearing changes indicated small changes in swim direction or more linear swim paths.\n\nGeographic positions or tracks and speeds of commercial vessels (i.e., barges, cargo carriers, charters, ferries, law enforcement, tankers, tugs) with automatic identification system (AIS) signatures were automatically recorded onto Mysticetus at 30 s intervals through a dual channel Matsutec AR-10 USB receiver.Vessel type and approximate size of vessels with AIS signatures were obtained post hoc from recorded AIS tracks using Maritime Mobile Service Identity numbers and Marine Traffic [42].Vessels observed near dolphins without AIS (i.e., recreational vessels, ecotourism vessels) were tracked by marking at least two theodolite positions at the waterline along the hull, which enabled Mysticetus to automatically calculate vessel speed (m/s).Vessel type and categorical size (small, medium, large, extra-large; Table 2) were recorded in Mysticetus for each vessel tracked by theodolite.All vessels were categorized post hoc by type, size, and mean speed (Table 2).Barges and tank-barges were categorized as coastal cargo ships, charters and trawlers were categorized as fishing vessels, extra-large carriers and tankers were categorized as offshore commercial ships, law enforcement and port tenders were categorized as enforcement, and inshore and offshore supply vessels were categorized as supply vessels.All vessel positions recorded within 300 m and 5 min of each dolphin position were selected and paired with the corresponding dolphin position for analyses [6].When multiple vessels were paired with a single dolphin position, the number of vessels was totaled, the vessel type and size were defined as \"mixed\" if multiple categories were present, and the speed (m/s) and distance (m) of the vessel nearest to the paired dolphin were used in analyses.Vessels were categorized as absent when no vessel was recorded within 300 m and 5 min of a dolphin position; thus, vessel type and size were defined as \"none\".\n\nSeasons were defined as summer (June-August), fall (September-November), winter (December-February), and spring (March-May).Sampling occurred throughout the day, categorized into morning (800-1059 h), midday (1100-1359 h), early afternoon (1400-1659 h), and late afternoon (1700-2000 h).\n\n\nAnalyses\n\nStatistical software RStudio (version 2022.07.2) was used to analyze dolphin behavioral and movement patterns relative to vessels.A multinomial logistic regression (MLR) using the \"nnet\" package was used to analyze the relationship between behavioral states and predictor variables [43][44][45].The eight predictor variables were categorical (season, time of day, vessel type, vessel size) and numerical (group size, vessel speed, number of vessels, and vessel distance from dolphin(s)).Travel was used as the behavioral reference as it involves consistent movement and occurred often.Summer and midday were the temporal references as most collection effort occurred during those times.Vessel type \"none\" and vessel size \"none\" were used as reference groups as they indicated vessel absence.An augmented pairs plot was used to assess potential collinearity between predictor variables and variables demonstrating multicollinearity, and the less explicable variable was removed from the model.MLR models were compared by stepwise removal of predictor variables based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) from the fully saturated model to a proposed model [46].The best-fitting model was selected with the lowest AIC and deviance [46,47].The final MLR model's goodness of fit of the observed data with the expected results was tested using a Pearson's chi-squared test and explained with Nagelkerke Pseudo-R-square test.Log-likelihood ratio tests were used to determine the significance of categorical predictor variables on behavioral state in the model.Contingency tables showed the relationship between significant predictor variables and behavioral state [47].The \"multcomp\" package in RStudio was used to perform a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a post hoc Tukey test with Shaffer adjustment on significant numerical predictor variables.\n\nGeneralized additive models (GAMs) were used in RStudio with the \"mgcv\" package to analyze potential explanatory variables for swim speed and bearing change [48][49][50].There were nine potential explanatory categorical variables (season, time of day, vessel type, vessel size) and numerical variables (group size, number of calves, vessel speed, number of vessels present, and distance of nearest vessel to dolphin(s)).Shapiro-Wilk normality tests (a = 0.05) were used to determine if the data were distributed normally.Collinearity among potential explanatory variables was assessed with augmented pairs plots and variance inflation factor (VIF) values.If collinearity was detected between potential explanatory variables, the less explicable variable was removed from the model.Smoothing terms enabled model flexibility of the GAM by assigning the number of knots for smooth terms in the model [48,51].The default of 10 knots was used unless smoothed variables contained less than 10 levels, in which case knot selection was reduced.The condition for removing smooth terms, smoothing functions, and linear terms from the full model included a decrease in the generalized cross-validation (GCV) score, an increase in the R 2 -adjusted value, and an increase in the deviance-explained percentage [48].If these conditions were not met, the terms were retained in the model.Linear mixed-effects modelling, using the lme function (package \"nlme\"), was run to detect temporal autocorrelation of residuals in the selected models.If a highly significant correlation was detected, autoregressive models AR(1) and ARMA were applied to improve the autocorrelation plots, or data were filtered based on the most significant lag positions.\n\n\nResults\n\nData were collected from theodolite stations in Port Aransas for 63 days and 287.8 h from June 2021 to September 2022.Data collection occurred during all seasons (summer: n = 124.6 h, mean 41.5 h/month; fall: n = 61.7 h, mean 20.6 h/month; winter: n = 40.7 h, mean 13.6 h/month; spring: n = 60.8 h, mean 20.2 h/month) and times of day (morning: n = 51.5 h, mean 1.4 h/day; midday: n = 112.3h, mean 2.0 h/day; early afternoon: n = 81.9h, mean 1.7 h/day; late afternoon: n = 24.9h, mean 1.8 h/day).Most data collection effort occurred during the summer months and during the midday period (Table S1).A total of 6189 positions of dolphins were collected and used in various analyses: 4339 positions were used in behavioral analyses, 4018 positions were used in swimming speed analyses, and 4372 positions were used in bearing-change analyses.Foraging (n = 1869 positions, 40% of tracks) was the primary dolphin behavioral state in the CCSC-Aransas Pass confluence area, followed by traveling (n = 1127 positions, 24% of tracks), socializing (n = 683 positions, 15% of tracks), milling (n = 660 positions, 14% of tracks), orienting against current (n = 316 positions, 7% of tracks), and resting (n = 45 positions, 1% of tracks).\n\nA total of 644 dolphin groups were tracked with a daily mean (±SD) of 10.2 ± 4.2 groups (range = 3-28 groups).Group sizes ranged from 1 to 25 dolphins (mean ± SD adults = 4.58 ± 3.0) with 0-4 calves present (mean ± SD calves = 0.17 ± 0.5).Dolphins were not individually identified; thus, the total number of adults (2949) and calves (112) may be smaller due to potential resightings of a dolphin across groups.\n\nA total of 6584 vessels were tracked with a daily mean (±SD) of 105 ± 40.6 vessels (range = 17-241 vessels).Vessel presence varied seasonally (summer: n = 2744, mean = 22.0 vessels/h; fall: n = 1571, mean = 25.5 vessels/h; winter: n = 920, mean = 22.6 vessels/h; spring: n = 1349, mean = 22.2 vessels/h) and with time of day (morning: n = 1595, mean = 30.9vessels/h; midday: n = 2594, mean = 23.1 vessels/h; early afternoon: n = 1808, mean = 22.1 vessels/h; late afternoon: n = 587, mean = 23.6 vessels/h).Eighty percent of tracked dolphin positions had vessels present within 300 m and 5 min.On average (±SD), 2 ± 1.7 vessels (range = 0-12 vessels) were present with each dolphin group.A total of 1318 vessels were within 300 m and 5 min of each dolphin position and subsequently used in analyses.\n\n\nBehavioral Patterns\n\nThe fully saturated MLR model overpredicted the more common behavioral states and masked the least common behavioral states (orient against current, rest); therefore, the least common behavioral states were excluded to improve the final MLR model.The final MLR model included the four most common behavioral states (forage, travel, social, mill; Table 3).Vessel distance to dolphins(s) was excluded from the analysis due to multicollinearity, and vessel speed was excluded based on AIC values.The best-fitting model for behavioral state (n = 4339 positions, AIC = 10,424.16,deviance = 10,286.16)included the significant predictor variables of season, time of day, group size, vessel type, vessel size, and number of vessels present (X 2 9 = 405.14,p < 0.001; Table 4).However, the Nagelkerke pseudo-R-square was 21%, showing a weak goodness of fit between behavioral states and predictor variables.The patterns described for frequencies of occurrence refer to statistical trends of occurrences expected by chance.Dolphins foraged frequently in the winter in the morning and late afternoon and infrequently in the summer and early afternoon (Tables S2 and S3).Traveling frequently occurred in the early afternoon and infrequently in the spring and late afternoon, while milling occurred frequently in the summer (Tables S2 and S3).Dolphins socialized extensively in the spring with little socialization in the winter (Table S2).Milling and socializing occurred in similar amounts across all times of day (Table S3).\n\nA statistically significant difference was found in dolphin group size across behavioral states (F(3, 4339) = 67.49,p < 0.001), with large groups engaged more in foraging (t = 6.23, p < 0.001), socializing (t = 12.22, p < 0.001), and milling (t = 10.96,p < 0.001) than traveling.Dolphin group sizes were not significantly different when socializing or milling (t = 1.01, p > 0.05), yet larger when compared to foraging (t = 8.00, p < 0.001; t = 6.68, p < 0.001, respectively).\n\nMost dolphins were tracked when there were \"mixed\" (multiple) vessel types and \"mixed\" vessel sizes within 300 m and 5 min of a dolphin position (Figure 2; 39 and 38% of positions, respectively).Dolphins foraged particularly frequently near ferries, fishing vessels, and enforcement vessels (Figure 2 and Table S4) and near vessels of mixed sizes, yet infrequently near small sized vessels (Table S5).Traveling frequently occurred when supply vessels and tugs were nearby (Figure 2; Table S4) and when no vessels were present, yet infrequently when mixed vessel types and sizes were nearby (Table S5).Dolphins foraged, traveled, and socialized in similar proportions when ecotourism vessels were proximate (Figure 2).Socializing occurred more than other behavioral states when supply vessels (Figure 2; Table S4) and small vessel sizes were nearby (Table S5).Milling occurred frequently when coastal cargo ships and small vessel sizes were nearby and infrequently when ferries were nearby or no vessels were present (Figure 2; Tables S4 and S5).There was a statistically significant difference in the number of vessels present across behavioral states (F(3, 4339) = 23.49,p < 0.001); when many vessels were present, dolphins foraged (t = 7.93, p < 0.001), milled, (t = 6.23, p < 0.001), and socialized (t = 4.31, p < 0.001) more often compared to traveling.There were no significant differences associated with the number of vessels present and dolphins engaged in milling and foraging (t = 0.14, p > 0.05), socializing and foraging (t = −2.01,p > 0.05), and socializing and milling (t = −1.77,p > 0.05).\n\n\nSwimming Speed and Bearing-Change Patterns\n\nAutocorrelation existed between swimming-speed model residuals, thus the second data point for each focal individual/group was removed.The application of autoregressive models AR(1) and ARMA to the swimming-speed and bearing-change data did not improve the autocorrelation plots.Swimming speed (W = 0.717, p < 0.001) and bearing change (W = 0.934, p < 0.001) were not normally distributed; however, the sample size is robust (n = 4018 and 4372 positions, respectively).Generalized additive models (GAMs) used the quasi-likelihood family in which the distribution assumption can be relaxed [52].Due to multicollinearity, vessel size, speed, and distance to dolphin(s) were excluded.The best-fitting GAM describing significant variations in swimming speed (adj-R 2 = 0.0602, GCV = 0.454, deviance explained = 6.55%) including explanatory smooth terms (group size, number of calves) and linear terms (season, time, vessel type, number of vessels present) is:  There was a

confluence area consistently encounter heavy vessel traffic all year round; this study shows that > 20 vessels per hour typically pass through the area with a daily mean of 105 vessels present during daylight hours.Vessels were proximate to 80% of dolphin groups, with two vessels near each group on average, and this anthropogenic disturbance appears to have substantial effects on dolphin behavioral states and movement patterns.Vessels of mixed sizes were near dolphins most often, supporting that a variety of vessel types and sizes pass through the CCSC daily [28].Despite high vessel traffic, bottlenose dolphins consistently use the industrialized CCSC-Aransas Pass confluence area primarily to forage, travel, socialize, and mill, with little orienting against current or resting occurring.Dolphins foraged most in the winter, consistent with historical movement of prey species through Texas passes in the winter and early spring (flounder, Paralichthys lethostigma, P. albigutta [53]; red drum, Sciaenops ocellatus [54]; spotted seatrout, Cynoscion nebulosus [55]).High occurrences of dolphin foraging in the morning and late afternoon and low occurrences in the early afternoon are congruent with other studies along the Texas coast [3,37], and are consistent with this study's findings of slow swimming speeds in morning and late afternoon.Frequent changes in direction and slow swimming while foraging may reflect the coordinated herding of prey [56].Thus, the comparatively fast swimming speeds and linear swimming paths of dolphins in the summer are consistent with reduced foraging during the summer and may reflect reduced prey availability.Although some prey species leave the CCSC and move into the Texas bays in the spring and summer [53,54,57], dolphins remained present in the CCSC during these seasons with reduced traveling and increased milling.High occurrences of traveling in the early afternoon are consistent with other studies [3,33].The high occurrences of socializing in the spring, which is a behavioral state associated with slow swimming speeds and high bearing changes, may be indicative of mating as bottlenose dolphins have a 12-month gestation period and there were high numbers of calf sightings in the spring (April and May) [29].As the mean number of vessels present per hour was highest in the fall and during the morning and late afternoon, dolphins may swim slowly in non-linear paths (i.e., many bearing changes) during these periods to avoid extensive vessel traffic and potential vessel strikes [4,6,22].\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nBottlenose dolphins in the CCSC-Aransas Pass confluence area consistently encounter heavy vessel traffic all year round; this study shows that >20 vessels per hour

vessels present per hour was highest in the fall and during the morning and late afternoon, dolphins may swim slowly in non-linear paths (i.e., many bearing changes) during these periods to avoid extensive vessel traffic and potential vessel strikes [4,6,22].\n\nLarge group sizes were associated with foraging, socializing, and milling behavioral states.As three channels converge in the CCSC-Aransas Pass area before flowing into the Gulf of Mexico, dolphins may feed, mate, and play in large groups before traveling out of the area in smaller groups.Dolphin group sizes were smaller when foraging compared to milling and socializing potentially because larger groups may reduce the net yield per individual [38].Dolphins swam slower and increased directional changes with increasing group size, possibly as a protective response to vessel traffic in the CCSC, especially when calves are present.The increased presence of calves may drive slow group swim speeds and large directional changes, possibly for mothers to maintain contact with calves while avoiding vessel activity [58].Calves have been observed in the CCSC-Aransas Pass confluence area during every month of the year and mother-calf pairs have been described in other studies as fusing with groups rather than remaining alone [29].As most dolphin groups in this study were small (averaging 5 individuals) with no calves present (averaging <1 calf per group), the fast swim speeds and decreased directional changes identified with larger groups (>15 individuals) or with additional calves (>3 calves) may not indicate accurate movement patterns.\n\nVessel activity influenced all dolphin behavioral states in the CCSC.Dolphins frequently foraged in the presence of multiple vessel sizes in contrast to dolphins in the Galveston Ship Channel, Texas, that foraged infrequently when vessels were present [3,16].The collective movement of vessels of various sizes may aid in mixing surface currents and nutrients, increasing prey abundance, or displacing prey.Foraging occurred frequently when the ferry was proximate to dolphins, similar to another study in Texas waters [16].The mixing of nutrients and currents from consistent ferry movement and the channel confluence area may increase prey abundance in ferry lanes.Although infrequently observed (1% of observations), resting occurred most often when ferries were near dolphins.Dolphins may rest along the channel periphery between bouts of foraging near the Port Aransas ferry; however, resting behavior should be interpreted with caution given the low sample size.Low occurrences of resting behavior during the daytime have been documented in the Patos Lagoon estuary, Brazil, an area of high vessel activity [58], and increased resting may occur at night [59] in the absence of vessel traffic [3,15,17].While OAC was infrequently observed, most occurrences were near fishing vessels where frequent bearing changes and traditional foraging occurred, supporting the hypothesis that OAC may be a foraging specialization in the dredged CCSC [39].\n\nWhile bottlenose dolphins appear to vary swim speed and bearing change with vessel type, dolphins swam quickly with less linear paths when many vessels were present, possibly to avoid potential vessel strikes.Traveling involves linear movement between locations.Traveling frequently occurred when supply vessels and tugs were nearby, possibly because their slow and predictable movements may reduce the perceived injury risk to dolphins.The low frequency of bearing changes near tug vessels further supports that dolphins were traveling in a fast linear direction.Traveling also occurred frequently when no vessels were present.Traveling often occurred frequently in other industrialized areas when vessels were present [16,17].High vessel traffic in the CCSC-Aransas Pass confluence area could interrupt linear dolphin travel between channels, prompting dolphins to travel more when vessels are absent and potentially mill frequently with high vessel activity [17].Dolphins milled less than expected by chance when no vessels were present yet frequently when coastal cargo and small vessels were present.The increased maneuverability of small vessels allows them to move in fast, unpredictable patterns, potentially prompting evasive movements from dolphins to avoid collisions [6].In the CCSC, dolphins may mill often with small vessel presence, as the frequent heading changes and nondirectional movement characterized as milling may be a response to unpredictable small vessel operation.Socializing occurred more than other behavioral states when supply vessels and small vessel sizes were nearby.Dolphins in close proximity may initially attract small vessels to observe them.Contrary to previous studies [15,17], dolphins in the CCSC appeared to socialize in the presence of small vessels (e.g., ecotourism, per-sonal recreational); however, it is undetermined whether dolphins decrease social behavior during vessel approaches or engage in avoidance responses near fast-moving vessels as observed elsewhere [6,15,19,20].Dolphin-watching ecotourism vessels were often observed closely following dolphin groups in the CCSC.Dolphins swam slowly with large changes in bearing, engaging in similar proportions of foraging, travelling, and socializing.Although ecotourism vessels can alter dolphin abundance, behavior, and movement [6,17,18], dolphins may also become habituated, desensitized, or tolerant and exhibit no external response to vessel presence [16,19,60,61].For similar reasons, dolphins may have swum slowly in the presence of fishing, mixed, enforcement, and personal vessel types, all of which move fast and unpredictably.Previous studies showed that small vessels moving at fast speeds interrupted dolphin behavioral states [6,15,19,20] and increased dolphin swimming speeds and changes in direction [3,4,6,20,22].\n\nThe number of vessels present consistently has effects on dolphin behavioral states and movement patterns [3,4,19,20,22,62].Up to 12 vessels were observed with a single dolphin group.Dolphins swam faster and had greater bearing changes as the number of vessels increased.Vessel activity in the CCSC-Aransas Pass area is extensive and has been categorized by the U.S. Coast Guard as one of the most dangerous areas for vessel traffic as it is a blind spot for large vessels [27].However, bottlenose dolphins continue to use the confluence area to forage, socialize, and mill with large numbers of vessels present, indicating that dolphins may be habituated or desensitized to high volumes of vessel traffic [16,60,61].Dolphins may remain in the CCSC-Aransas Pass confluence area due to high prey abundance despite potential risks of vessel strikes.\n\nThis study provides insights into bottlenose dolphin behavior and movement patterns during vessel interactions in the CCSC.Vessel operations in close proximity to dolphins may lead to long-term behavioral changes that impact social structure and habitat use or cause injuries and death to dolphins [4,6,17].We recommend that future studies explore how vessel speed affects dolphins.Continued studies on dolphin behavior, group composition and dynamics, and movement patterns in the CCSC are vital to monitor anthropogenic impacts to dolphins as coastal operations in Corpus Christi and Port Aransas are ongoing.For example, the effects of vessels on dolphin groups with and without calves may yield further insights into evasion and habituation to vessels.Fine-scale responses of dolphins to vessel presence (e.g., diving behavior, acoustic communication, duration of dolphin and vessel interactions, variation in distances between vessel operations and dolphins, vessel speed approaches and directions) will improve understanding of the effects of vessel activity on dolphins in the CCSC.Long-term monitoring projects of vessel impacts on dolphins have led to management practice and policy changes including the establishment of speed restriction zones [23], curtailed numbers and duration of daily dolphin-watching ecotourism trips [62], and enforced defined vessel approach distances to dolphins [24].As laws for boating around dolphins in Texas are currently lacking, extensive knowledge of the impacts of vessel operations on Texas dolphins could prompt the development of boating regulations near dolphins to better protect the species.Vessel activity and infrastructure development in the CCSC-Aransas Pass area have increased substantially in recent decades, with dolphins possibly habituated or desensitized to disturbances.Long-term monitoring of bottlenose dolphins in the area is recommended to understand dolphin abundance, occurrence, site fidelity, habitat use, and response to increasing anthropogenic operations.Knowledge of dolphin behavior and movement patterns near vessels can prompt sustainable planning efforts to minimize the long-term health impacts of anthropogenic disturbances on coastal Texas dolphins.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nBottlenose dolphins foraged, traveled, socialized, and milled across all seasons and times of day in the CCSC-Aransas Pass confluence area, despite high vessel traffic, dredging, and marine construction.The quantity of vessels varied seasonally and across times of day and are known to affect dolphin behavior and movement in the area [29,30].Most (80%) dolphins were observed with vessels present and swam faster in less linear paths as the number of vessels increased.While vessel presence > 300 m from dolphins was not assessed, distant vessels may effect dolphin behavior and movement in the CCSC as acoustic signals travel far.Foraging often occurred near ferries and dolphins may rest between bouts of foraging.Resting was observed infrequently as dolphins may leave the area to rest away from high volumes of vessel traffic.Contrary to previous studies [6,16,17], foraging, traveling, and socializing occurred when ecotour vessels were present, suggesting that dolphins may be desensitized or tolerant of dolphin-watching tours; however, this study did not determine pre-and post-tour responses.Insight into interactions between vessels and dolphins could highlight the urgency for continued monitoring of anthropogenic activities and the creation of regulations for proper vessel operation near dolphins.humans continue to use marine environments, it is important to understand the impacts anthropogenic activities have on coastal species.As the Port of Corpus Christi continues to play its part in oil exportation and proceeds with infrastructure growth to support additional and larger vessels, investigating how dolphin behavior and movement patterns vary with temporal patterns, group size, and vessel interactions is necessary to inform the management of support for species protection.\n\n\nSupplementary Materials:\n\nThe following

Aug. 2022 Accepted: 19 Sept. 2023legalisationcannabismedical studentmedicinal cannabisrecreational cannabismedical training curricula\nBackground: Recreational and medicinal use of cannabis is topical in the light of more permissive legislation regarding the substance worldwide.Aim:The primary purpose of this study is to determine the attitudes that final-year medical students at the University of Pretoria (UP) hold about recreational and medicinal use of cannabis, as well as determining if they feel they are being adequately trained in this regard.Setting: The research was conducted at Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital, affiliated with the UP.Methods:The study follows a cross-sectional, comparative, quantitative design.Data were collected by means of a structured questionnaire.Final-year medical students were identified as participants via a convenience sampling technique.Participation was voluntary and anonymous.Results: A total of 57 valid responses were recorded.The study shows that most medical students had permissive views about cannabis and that the majority feel that they are not being adequately trained to advise patients about medical cannabis in a lecture setting (64.9%, n = 37) or clinical setting (68.4%, n = 38).Results also show that previous personal experience with cannabis led to more permissive views.Conclusion:This study illustrates the need for academic research regarding medicinal cannabis but interestingly shows that medical students want more guidance from their training institution about the topic.Contribution:This research shows that the conversation surrounding cannabis in medicine is continuous and universities should make a conscious effort to familiarise students with the topic.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOver the past few years, South Africa has experienced a major shift in terms of cannabis laws.Following the ruling of the Constitutional Act in September of 2018, Sections 4(b) and 5(b) of the Drugs and Drug Trafficking Act as well as Section 22A(9)(a)(i) of the Medicines and Related Substances Act, it was found that an individual's fundamental right to privacy was encroached upon and therefore deemed unconstitutional. 1 The global trend towards cannabis use seems to be that people are more interested in its use, both recreational and medicinal, and less critical or conservative in their view of the previously often vilified drug. 2,3,4This means that practitioners will increasingly be confronted with patients seeking information about the validity and safety of using cannabis for different ailments in the near future.This poses two questions: firstly, what is a practitioner's personal view on using cannabis as well as what factors form this particular view?and secondly, does the practitioner feel like they have an adequate knowledge base about cannabis to confidently advise their patients?\n\nIt is also important to note that relaxing the cannabis laws in a country or state may lead to more permissive views among its citizens. 4A recent study done in the United States, focusing on the attitudes of young adults, found that the youths living in states where cannabis has been legalised (for either medicinal or recreational use) had significantly more liberal ideas about the drug than their peers living in states where cannabis is still illegal. 5It is also suggested that attitudes and beliefs about substances are forged during the late adolescence and early adulthood period of life. 6,7The study also illustrated the general trend towards a more open-minded approach concerning cannabis among the American youth, finding that young adults in 2013 are almost two-and-a-half times more likely to have permissive views about the drug when compared to the same age group in 2004. 5Again it seems important then to have an idea about what our own future practitioners, as young adults, think when it comes to cannabis.\n\nThere are a significant number of studies that examine the viewpoint that already established and practising medical doctors hold about medical cannabis, but few that look into the beliefs of future practitioners.A literature search found only two studies that were conducted by Chan et al. 3 in America and Vujicic et al. 2 in Serbia that specifically focus on medical students' attitudes towards the drug and both had similar results.Both of these studies were done using questionnaires that enquired about a few main themes, including previous use of cannabis, current knowledge about cannabis (both clinical indications for its use and side effects) and lastly their personal view with regard to both the medicinal and recreational use of marijuana.These two studies were conducted at the University of Colorado and the University of Belgrade, respectively. 2,3sults from these studies showed that the majority of students were in favour of the legalisation and medicinal use of cannabis that male students are significantly more likely to try the drug than their female peers and that students who had previously experimented with cannabis held more liberal views about the drug's legalisation and use as opposed to students who have not.Furthermore, the studies also showed that students who had experimented with cannabis displayed more knowledge about the conditions that cannabis could be used for, conversely students who had no experience with the drug had more knowledge pertaining to cannabis's side effect profile. 2,3rthermore, Vujicic et al. 2 asked the students to identify sources from which they attained knowledge about medical marijuana.Internet and television were found to be the places where students found most of their information, with formal university education falling far behind.Accordingly, it can be argued that tertiary institutions need to assess whether they are adequately preparing and equipping future doctors with the necessary knowledge and skills when it comes to the controversial topic of medical marijuana.\n\nA recent study conducted at the University of the Free State looked at the prevalence of cannabis and tested knowledge pertaining to the negative side effects of cannabis in the undergraduate medical student group.Results showed that although lifetime prevalence and patterns of cannabis use are similar to those reported by other South African studies (not specific to medical students), medical students consistently had poor knowledge about the negative side effects associated with the drug. 8When we look at research conducted elsewhere in Africa, we see a different reality.A study conducted in Nigeria showed that the majority (84.5%) of fifth-year medical students who participated did not agree with legalisation of cannabis and the majority had conservative views about cannabis use as well as the use of other psychoactive substances. 9e primary objective of this study was to determine the attitudes of final-year medical students enrolled at the University of Pretoria (UP) towards the legalisation of cannabis.Secondary objectives included determining the attitudes and knowledge that these same students have with regard to the medicinal and recreational use of cannabis, investigating the effects of previous cannabis use on the students' attitudes and knowledge about cannabis.The authors also wanted to determine whether students at the UP are of the opinion that the current curriculum adequately prepares them when it comes to the issue of medical cannabis.Lastly, the results of this study will also be compared to the results of studies done abroad.\n\n\nResearch methods and design\n\n\nStudy design\n\nThis study was a cross-sectional and quantitative study.Data were collected from participants using a specifically designed questionnaire that contained questions about demographics, personal experience with cannabis and views and/or attitudes about legalisation of cannabis as well as the medical and recreational use of cannabis.This questionnaire was self-designed keeping the aims of the study in mind and consists of 34 questions.The questionnaire was not based on a standardised scale and was rather assessed subjectively through face validity.\n\n\nSetting\n\nThis research was conducted at Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital.Weskoppies Hospital (WKH) is a tertiary specialist psychiatric hospital located in Pretoria West, Gauteng and is affiliated to the UP as well as the Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University and Nursing colleges.\n\n\nStudy population and sampling strategy\n\nStudent intern complex (SIC) students are medical students, also called student interns, who are completing the last 18 months of their training at the university before being employed as Intern Doctors in the Department of Health.Student intern complex groups consist of both fifth-year and final-year medical students, meaning that approximately half the group would already have completed a clinical rotation in psychiatry and the other half's first exposure to such a rotation.This particular group of students made up the study population of the research project.In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, large gatherings were not possible for data collection and online questionnaires have markedly low response rates.\n\nThe original plan was to gain maximal participation by distributing the questionnaire to the entire final-year student group to complete after they had their block orientation.However, the pandemic curtailed this plan and forced the researchers to change the methodology of the study.Accordingly, a convenience sampling technique was used to select students for the study, ultimately weakening the validity of the date because of a smaller sample size, but allowing research to continue in a safe way, abiding by the rules set in place by the University.\n\nInclusion criteria for the participants included that they have to be a registered SIC student at the UP as well as willing to participate voluntarily and able to provide informed consent at the time of completing the questionnaire.Exclusion criteria included not being a registered SIC student or being unwilling to participate or provide informed consent.\n\nThese data were collected between two SIC groups that rotated through WKH between January 2021 and March 2021 in a lecture room setting, meaning that the participants completed the questionnaire immediately as they received it.There was a total of 84 possible participants (42 in each group), a total of 61 students participated, but only 57 responses were valid.Four questionnaires were either incomplete or participants gave more than one answer in questions where only one response was asked.\n\n\nData collection\n\nThe instrument for data collection was a specifically designed, self-compiled questionnaire and contained questions divided into the following headings: (1) demographics, (2) attitude towards legalisation of cannabis, (3) knowledge and opinion on use of cannabis both recreational and medicinal, (4) adequate training and/or education regarding cannabis and (5) personal use and/or experience with cannabis.Please see the included tables for a more comprehensive view of the questions asked.\n\nEach questionnaire also had an informed consent form that had to be completed for the questionnaire to be valid.The questionnaires were distributed in person by the primary investigator to participating students, keeping all social distancing and other precautions in mind.The participants were able to raise any doubts or concerns about the questions to the primary investigator for clarification.\n\n\nData analysis\n\nData from the questionnaires were captured electronically by the researcher and any further analysis was done by a statistician using SAS version 9.2.Descriptive statistics, namely frequencies and percentages, were calculated for categorical data, and means and standard deviations or medians and percentiles were calculated for continuous data.The Shapiro-Wilk test was performed to investigate whether continuous data such as age followed a normal distribution. 10 this study, Cronbach's alpha (α) was used to calculate the internal consistency of items in the subscales (attitude towards legalisation of cannabis, knowledge and opinion on the use of cannabis both recreational and medicinal as well as personal use and/or experience with cannabis) in the questionnaire.According to George and Mallery, a Cronbach's alpha value above 0.90 indicates excellent internal consistency, above 0.80 is good, above 0.70 is acceptable, above 0.60 is questionable, above 0.50 is poor and below 0.50 is unacceptable. 11Analytical statistics namely Fisher's exact test was used to compare proportions between groups.A significance level (ɑ) of 0.05 was used in this study, meaning a level of less than 0.05 would be significant.\n\n\nEthical consideration\n\nThe study was approved by the Faculty of Health Sciences Research Ethics Committee of the University of Pretoria (reference number: 621/2020).The Executive Committee of the School of Medicine gave permission to include students in the study.Written informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to distribution of the questionnaire and participants were informed that they could withdraw from the study at any point.\n\n\nResults\n\nAs mentioned previously, there were a total of 61 responses out of a possible 84, resulting in a participation rate of 72.6%.Fifty-seven of these responses were valid constituting a response rate of 93.4%.The study sample consisted of 21 male (36.84%) and 36 female (63.16%) students.According to the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality, the distribution of the age of the participants did not follow a normal distribution (W = 0.800, p < 0.0001).Consequently, the median (24 years) and the interquartile range (lower quartile = 23 years, upper quartile = 26 years) are reported on.Regarding other qualifications, the majority of students (82.46%) had no prior qualifications, eight students (14.04%) had obtained a Bachelor's degree and only two students (3.5%) had either a Master's or an Honours degree.\n\nThe first subscale of the questionnaire included questions about the participant's attitudes towards the legalisation of cannabis and the reliability analysis resulted in a Cronbach's alpha of 0.65, indicating questionable internal consistency.Figure 1 presents a summary of the results.\n\nThe next subscale comprised questions about the participant's knowledge and opinion on the use of cannabis, both recreationally and medicinally.The Cronbach's alpha for this subscale was 0.7, indicating acceptable internal consistency.A breakdown of the results of this subscale is represented in Figure 2.\n\nOf the participants, just over half (n = 29, 50.9%) mentioned that they would recommend cannabis to a patient under current law and practice guidelines.It also showed that 68.4% (n = 39) of participants believe that cannabis has significant physical benefits but 42.9% (n = 30) believe that cannabis does not have any significant mental health benefits.\n\nThe third section of the questionnaire investigated the participant's opinion about adequate training and education regarding cannabis.The majority of students (n = 56, 98.2%) agreed that teaching about cannabis should be included in the medical school curricula and the entire study population agreed that physicians should receive formal training prior to recommending cannabis to patients.Detailed answers to this subscale are represented in Figure 3.\n\nWhen asked what sources students used to gain information about cannabis, they indicated that 31.6% (n = 18) gained information mainly from television, radio and media articles, 21.1% (n = 12) indicated information was gained from the recreational use of cannabis by their friends and/or family and 19.3% (n = 11) said that medical literature was their main source of information.Classroom lectures and information from senior colleagues (medical officers and/or registrars and/or consultants) were only shown to be six students' (10.5%) main source of information about cannabis.\n\nThe last section of the questionnaire investigated students' personal use and/or experience with cannabis.Of the 57 participants, 33 (57.9%) indicated that they have used cannabis in the past.Of those 33 students, 18 had used cannabis in the past year, 7 had used cannabis in the past month and 4 had used cannabis in the past week, leaving 4 students who used cannabis more than a year ago.The majority of these students indicated that they used cannabis for recreational purposes (n = 29, 87.9%) and the remaining 12.1% (n = 4) reports using it for both medicinal and recreational purposes.\n\nStudents who had any personal experience with cannabis were compared to those who had never used the drug before and how that might influence their attitudes and views about the legalisation of cannabis.It was found that students who had prior personal experience with cannabis were more in favour of legalising cannabis, recommending cannabis to patients and were against practitioners being subject to legal or criminal penalties for recommending cannabis to patients.There was, however, no significant difference between the two groups of students (p = 0.3955).Agree Disagree Note: Q1: If cannabis were legally available, I would recommend use of cannabis to a patient.Q2: Cannabis should be legalised for recreational use.Q3: Government should abolish criminal penalties relating to consumption and/or possession of cannabis.Q4: A physician that recommends medical cannabis to a patient should be subject to action against his and/ or her medical license.Q5: A physician that recommends medical cannabis to a patient should be subject to legal and/or criminal penalties.Agree Disagree Note: Q6: Under current law and practice guidelines, I would recommend the use of cannabis to a patient.Q7: Physicians should recommend cannabis as a medical therapy.Q8: There are significant physical health benefits to using cannabis.Q9: There are significant mental health benefits to using cannabis.Q10: Cannabis can be addictive.Q11: Using cannabis poses serious health risks.Q12: Using cannabis poses serious mental health risks.Q13: Physicians should have ongoing relationships with patients for whom they recommend medical cannabis.Agree Disagree\n\nSignificant differences were seen with an increase in the frequency of use.Students that had used cannabis in the past month compared to students with no personal experience with cannabis had significant differences with regard to their views towards legalisation of cannabis.These differences were even more pronounced between students that had used cannabis in the past week and those who had not used cannabis at all.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nAs mentioned earlier, globally there is an increase in more permissive views about cannabis as well as rapidly changing policies regarding the possession and use thereof.An increasing amount of countries around the world have legalised cannabis use for specific groups of patients, or in some instances complete decriminalisation that allows for recreational use of cannabis.Germany, Italy, Spain, France, Romania, the Czech Republic, Colombia and 23 states in the United States have already legalised some form of medical cannabis. 12Other countries that have followed suit include: Canada, Austria, the Netherlands, Portugal, Finland and Israel. 13Certain studies also illustrate a relationship between decriminalisation policies and more permissive views about cannabis, especially in adolescents and young adults. 4,5This is an important point taking into account that the attitudes and beliefs people foster about substances are formed during late adolescence and early adulthood.It is also important to note that young adults are likely to be the most affected when it comes to more permissive policies regarding cannabis seeing that they are of voting age and thus more attuned to policy debates.They are also at the peak years of possible exposure and engagement with cannabis across their lifespan. 14,15ere is not a vast amount of literature investigating cannabis use in medical students, but a systematic review and metaanalysis conducted in 2018 and consisting of 38 studies showed a lifetime prevalence of cannabis use of 31.4% among medical students, past-year use of 17.2% and past-month use of 8.8%. 16These results are similar to the results obtained in two studies, conducted in Serbia and Colorado (USA) about attitudes of medical students surrounding the legalisation of cannabis. 2,3Similar to these two studies, the majority of participants in this study had favourable views about the medicinal use of cannabis and felt that medical practitioners should not be at risk of criminal prosecution if they recommend cannabis to a patient.\n\nCannabis education was the second theme to be explored in this study, focusing on what sources students used to obtain information about cannabis and whether they felt like they were being adequately prepared to counsel and advise patients regarding its use.The majority of students (n = 56, 98.2%) agreed that medical schools should include cannabis education in their curricula, yet a large proportion (n = 37, 64.9%) expressed that they felt they have not received adequate training in a lecture setting.A further 38 students (68.4%) expressed the same sentiment about cannabis education in a clinical setting.This dilemma may be exacerbated by the fact that just under half of the participants felt that the medical officers and registrars working with them were not knowledgeable enough about the medical effects of cannabis use and were not up to date with the most recent literature regarding medicinal cannabis.\n\nIt was also important to evaluate what sources students use in order to gain information about cannabis.This study found that the majority, accounting for just over a third, used mainstream media (television, radio and media articles) as their main source of information, which is concerning when comparing it to medical literature (19.3%, n = 11) and classroom lectures and/or information from senior colleagues (n = 6, 10.5%).This may suggest that there are too few medical education opportunities with regard to cannabis.It is therefore unsurprising that the majority (n = 37, 64.9%) felt like they were not knowledgeable enough to counsel a patient about cannabis use.These findings are consistent with international studies conducted about the same topic 2,3 and require further investigation, but one can safely assume that tertiary institutions should focus on including more cannabis-related education in their curricula.All students agreed that further research regarding cannabis and its effects needs to be conducted.\n\nOne must also consider the amount of training that students receive in the current curriculum regarding cannabis and its effects.Currently students rotate through a psychiatry block in fifth year that covers general psychiatry including substance-related disorders, followed by a clinical rotation in their final year lasting another 8 weeks.Students are provided with an ample amount of information regarding cannabis in the psychiatry sphere, but it is not known from the researchers' perspective how well cannabis education extends throughout the rest of the curriculum.This is of importance because cannabis is often used by patients to treat symptoms of illness other than psychological symptoms.Universities should be aware of this dilemma and perhaps consider conducting an internal survey with students to estimate the current amount of cannabis education and identify areas or disciplines that students' feel should be more comprehensive in their teaching.Additionally, perusing the curricula of other medical schools both locally and abroad may provide more insight into the cannabis education of doctors globally.\n\nA factor that may contribute to this difficulty is the relatively sparse database that exists for the medicinal use of cannabis in most conditions where its use is regularly advocated for.A few cannabinoids (dronabinol, nabilone) with high-quality evidence have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting as well as appetite stimulation in conditions that cause weight loss, and more recently, cannabidiol was approved for the treatment of Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.Chronic pain, muscle spasticity, tic disorders and Parkinson disease are major areas of research in the medical cannabis sphere with varying current evidence. 17his study also investigated the possible influence that prior experience with cannabis could have on the views and/or opinions expressed by a participant.The study found that prior cannabis use did have a relationship with more permissive and positive views about the substance and that the more frequent participants had used cannabis the more favourable their views tended to be.These findings are consistent with results from international studies showing that individuals with prior substance use, including cannabis, tend to perceive a lower risk of adverse effects related to the substance. 18e main limitation of this study would be the small sample group used.The study was originally designed to be conducted using the entire group of SIC students, but in accordance with COVID-19 precautions, the sampling strategy had to be altered.It has been shown that medical students are a relatively homogenous group, 19 but a larger sample size could have provided a more varied response to questionnaires.Further limitations can be drawn when assessing the internal consistency of the questionnaire and the fact that it was validated using face validity.Another limitation was the use of the rather dichotomous response of agree or disagree on the questionnaire, when a Likert scale with a scoring of five options would have had more utility.Lastly, when assessing the sources from where students obtained information about cannabis, opportunity should have been provided for multiple sources of information.This is key because in reality people will most commonly use more than one source and the sources themselves could then have been grouped into primary and secondary sources.\n\nThe second limitation could be the possible underreporting of cannabis use by students because of the stigma attached to cannabis use.However, it is important to note that this study used the principles of voluntary participation and complete anonymity to curtail this concern.\n\nFuture studies should be conducted once the cannabis laws in South Africa have been finalised and larger samples of participants can be used.However, this particular study captured a unique moment in time because of its topical nature, taking into account how recently South African cannabis legislature has evolved.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the study echoes certain similar points made by international studies.Cannabis laws are getting less restrictive globally.This means a possible increase in cannabis use in all patient populations and accordingly medical professionals will have to be ready to guide patients and offer advice regarding cannabis.More emphasis should be placed on the subject during the training of medical professionals, both in a clinical setting and classroom setting, seeing as current teaching practices have left the majority of students feeling unprepared to assist or advise patients.\n\n\n\nNote: Q15: Training about medical cannabis should be incorporated into medical school curricula.Q16: Physicians should have formal training about medical cannabis prior to recommending it to patients.Q17: Additional research regarding medical use of cannabis should be encouraged.Q18: During medical school, I have witnessed a physician act unprofessionally towards a patient based on medical cannabis use.Q19: In a lecture setting, I have been presented with adequate information about risks and/or benefits of cannabis use.Q20: In a clinical setting, I have been presented with adequate information about risks and/or benefits of cannabis use.Q21: I feel adequately knowledgeable to counsel a patient about cannabis use.Q22: The topic of medical cannabis is discussed professionally in medical school lectures.Q23: The topic of medical cannabis is discussed professionally in clinical settings.Q24: Medical officers and/or registrars that I have worked with are knowledgeable about the medical effects of cannabis use.Q25: Medical officers and/or registrars that I have worked with are knowledgeable about recent literature investigating the medical effects of cannabis use.\n\n\nFIGURE 3 :\n3\nFIGURE 3: Opinion about adequate

accounts 1930-2021\n7 November 202318600ABC8161C9FE48C971B11ACA7B23Received: 23 May 2023 -Discussion started: 4 July 2023 Revised: 4 September 2023 -Accepted: 22 September 2023 -\nThe main contributor to the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint of the cement industry is the decomposition of alkaline carbonates during clinker production.However, systematic accounts for the reverse of this process -namely carbonation of calcium oxide and other alkaline oxides and/or hydroxides within cement materials during cements' life cycles -have only recently been undertaken.Here, adopting a comprehensive analytical model, we provide the most updated estimates of CO 2 uptake by cement carbonation.The accumulated amount of global CO 2 uptake by cements produced from 1930 to 2021 is estimated to be 22.9 Gt CO 2 (95 % confidence interval, CI: 19.6-26.6Gt CO 2 ).This amount includes the CO 2 uptake by concrete, mortar, construction waste and kiln dust, accounting for 30.1 %, 58.5 %, 4.0 % and 7.1 % respectively.The cumulative carbon uptake by cement materials from 1930 to 2021 offsets 55.1 % of the emissions from cement production (41.6 Gt CO 2 , 95 % CI: 38.7-47.2Gt CO 2 ) over the same period, with the greater part coming from mortar (58.5 % of the total uptake).China has the highest cement carbon uptake, with cumulative carbonation of 7.06 Gt CO 2 (95 % CI: 5.22-9.44Gt CO 2 ) since 1930.In addition, the carbon uptake amounts of the USA, EU, India and the rest of the world took 5.0 %, 23.2 %, 5.6 % and 34.8 % separately.As a result of rapidly increased production in recent years, over three-quarters of the cement carbon uptake has occurred since 1990.Additionally, our results show little impact by the COVID-19 pandemic on cement production and use, with carbon uptake reaching about 0.92 Gt CO 2 (95 % CI: 0.78-1.10Gt CO 2 ) in 2020 and 0.96 Gt CO 2 (95 % CI: 0.81-1.15Gt CO 2 ) in 2021.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWith continued urbanization in the developing world and infrastructure projects worldwide, cement consumption has increased rapidly (Low, 2005).The cement production process is an energy-intensive and CO 2 -emitting process, the total CO 2 emission of which amounts to 5 %-8 % of global CO 2 emissions (IEA, 2019;Xuan and Poon, 2019;Friedlingstein et al., 2022).The worldwide average CO 2 emission coefficient of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) is 0.86 kgCO 2 kg −1 (Damtoft et al., 2008), which comprises the release of 0.53 kgCO 2 kg −1 of clinker owing to the decomposition of limestone during calcination.While in use, though, cement materials that are exposed to air naturally undergo carbonation (Pade and Guimaraes, 2007;Renforth et al., 2011;Huntzinger et al., 2009), a physicochemical process where atmospheric CO 2 gradually absorbs into concrete's structure and reacts with alkaline components such as CaO in a moist environment.The main carbonation mechanisms that are responsible for the carbon uptake can be attributed to the oxide, hydroxide and silicate constituents, as described by Reactions (R1) and (R2).\nCa(OH) 2 + CO 2 → CaCO 3 + H 2 O (R1) Ca x Si y O (x+2y) + xCO 2 + zH 2 O → xCaCO 3 + ySiO 2 • zH 2 O (R2)\nUnfortunately, from the perspective of offsetting emissions in the production of cement, carbonation is a slow process that occurs over the entire life cycle of cementitious materials, in contrast to the instantaneous CO 2 emissions that occur during their production (Andersson et al., 2013).It has been shown that up to a quarter of the CO 2 emitted in cement production can be reabsorbed throughout a building's life and recovery phase (Xi et al., 2016).Quite a few procedures for evaluating the CO 2 footprint over cement's life cycle have been suggested (Damineli et al., 2010;Renforth et al., 2011;Yang et al., 2013;Cao et al., 2020).Most procedures, however, consider only a case-limited system boundary and material type such as concrete service stage or the recycling phase of concrete after demolition (Andersson et al., 2013;Yang et al., 2014;Xi et al., 2016;Cao et al., 2020;Kaliyavaradhan et al., 2020) and do not take other types and stages of the life cycle into systematic account.In our previous study (Guo et al., 2021), which incorporated the merits from other work (Andersson et al., 2013;Yang et al., 2014;Xi et al., 2016;Cao et al., 2020;Kaliyavaradhan et al., 2020) and the updated clinker ratio and/or cement production data, we constructed a comprehensive analytical model to estimate the time series of cement CO 2 uptake inventories and estimated that 21.02 Gt CO 2 had been sequestered in cements produced between 1930 and 2019, which abated 55 % of the corresponding process emissions over the same period.\n\nThe cement CO 2 uptake and emission dataset can be accounted annually.In this study, based on the previous data frameworks (Guo et al., 2021), we updated cement production and emission factors and most up-to-date clinker ratio data for the years 2020 and 2021.Adopting a previous comprehensive analytical model (Guo et al., 2021), we updated the cement CO 2 uptake and emission dataset from 1930 to 2021.The inventories are constructed in a uniform format, which includes cement process-related emissions and cement uptake from four material types with three life stages that are burned in five countries or regions.The uniformly formatted time series cement uptake inventories can be utilized widely.Using these consistent frameworks and models, we provide an updated annual cement carbon uptake to be used in the annual assessments of the global carbon budget (GCB) (Friedlingstein et al., 2022).These timely updated inventories can provide robust data support for further analysis of global or regional emission reduction policy making, especially for carbon-intensive industries like the cement-manufacturing industry.By accelerating carbon capture from existing cement materials and using waste concrete as a carbon storage material, cement could reduce its net carbon emission impact.The primary focus of this research is to update the cement carbon uptake data up to 2021 using a methodology consistent with our previous publication.By doing so, we aim to provide the most current and up-to-date data to accurately portray the impact of cement carbon uptake.The data can be downloaded freely from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7516373(Bing et al., 2023).\n\n\nData and methods\n\nThe cement CO 2 uptake and process emissions in this dataset were estimated in terms of the comprehensive analytical model and based on the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) administrative territorial-based accounting scope.In addition, we also assessed the uncertainties in cement uptake and process emission estimates using the Monte Carlo method that the IPCC recommended.The detailed input data are in SI table 1 (available from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7516373,Bing et al., 2023).Our inventories were constructed in two parts: processrelated (cement) CO 2 emissions and cement material uptake.Figure 1 presents a diagram of the entire construction of our cement material carbonation uptake and cement emission inventories.\n\n\nCement production data sources\n\nTo keep the consistency with the previous study (Xi et al., 2016;Guo et al., 2021), we still obtained the global cement production data from 1930 to 2021 from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and geographically divided into five primary countries and aggregated regions, including China, the United States (US), Europe and central Eurasia (including Russia), India, and the rest of the world (ROW).In this study, we updated cement production for the years 2020 and 2021, and the global cement production was collected from the USGS cement statistics and information annual report (USGS, 2023); regional cement productions were gained from the China Statistical Yearbook (NBS, 2022), the USGS cement annual publication (USGS, 2023) and Trading Economics (Trading Economics, 2023) for China, the US, Europe and central Eurasia (including Russia), and India.The clinker ratio data were kept the same as the previous data sources (CCA, 2001(CCA, -2015;;Xu et al., 2012Xu et al., , 2014;;Cao et al., 2017;MIIT, 2019), except for the US, the data of which were collected from USGS annual cement report (USGS, 2023).\n\n\nCement process emission calculation\n\nIn producing cement clinker, the major constituent of cement (OPC), limestone and other carbonates are decomposed into their corresponding oxides and gaseous CO 2 via calcination, resulting in the process emission of the cement industry.It is a so-called hard-to-abate CO 2 emission source (Antunes et al., 2021) because no clear avenue has yet been found to replace this chemical process.Therefore, the process emission intensity (factor) is related to the composition of the clinker and its content in the cements in question.The IPCC-recommended default value of the process emission factor is 0.507 kg CO 2 kg −1 clinker (EFDB, 2002) without the emissions associated with MgCO 3 .In our work, the value of the clinker ratio for China was taken to be 0.51966 kg CO 2 kg −1 clinker for dry https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-4947-2023\n\nEarth Syst.Sci.Data, 15, 4947-4958, 2023\n\nkilns with pre-heating and without pre-calciner, dry kilns with pre-heating and pre-calciner, and dry kilns without pre-heating (long dry), and 0.49983 kg CO 2 kg −1 clinker for semi-wet or semi-dry and wet or shaft kilns since 2005, as adapted from Shen's study (Shen et al., 2016).For other countries, Andrew's recent work (Andrew, 2019) established a sound foundation for those who are in need of survey data (data can be accessed from SI table 1-3 from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7516373,Bing et al., 2023).Besides, the survey data were obtained from the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the Global Cement Directory 2019 (publicly named as the GCD-2019 dataset).Finally, the use of integrated global plant-level capacity and technology information was maintained and continued in this study for higher accuracy in contrast to regionally averaged cement emission factors (Guo et al., 2021).\n\nIn general, the process emission can be calculated using Eq.(1).Given the current types of cement additives, if statistical data on cement clinker production are available, it is recommended that cement clinker production data be used directly to accurately estimate process emissions (Andrew, 2019).\nE process,i = P cement,i × f clinker,i × EF CO 2 ,i(1)\nIn the above equation, E process,i is the cement process emission of the different regions.P cement,i is the regional cement production.f clinker,i and EF CO 2 ,i are the actual clinker-tocement ratios and the cement (clinker) carbon emission factors of these five regions respectively.\n\n\nCement life cycle uptake assessments\n\nThe cement utilization was categorized by four types: concrete, mortar, cement kiln dust and cementitious construction wastes, which included three life stages (Xi et al., 2016;Guo et al., 2021): (1) service, (2) demolishment and (3) second use.Thus, the whole carbon uptake process can be designed as\nC uptake = C concrete + C mortar + C wastes + C CKD ,(2)C concrete = C l,tl + C d,td + C s,ts ,(3)C mortar = C l,tl + C d,td + C s,ts ,(4)\nwhere C uptake , C concrete , C mortar , C wastes and C CKD are the uptake amounts of every type.C l,tl , C d,td and C s,ts are the uptake amounts during the service, demolition and secondary-use stages respectively.Following our previous study, 100 years were considered to be the total life cycle time.During the service stage, cement materials are mainly used for the construction of civil infrastructures.Based on Fick's second law, a simplified model was applied in this work, which introduced a two-dimensional diffusion slab process, as shown in Fig. 2. Fick's second law determines the relationship of carbonization depths and reaction time (tl) linked by diffusion coefficient (k), which can be described as follows:\nd = k √ tl. (5)\nThen, based on the reaction of cement carbonation and the IPCC's report, the carbonation calculation can be expressed as\nC = f clinker cement × f CaO clinker × γ × M CO 2 M CaO ,(6)\nwhere f clinker cement is the clinker ratio, f CaO clinker is the CaO content in the clinker, and γ is the fraction of CaO that could be converted to CaCO 3 .M CO 2 is molar mass of CO 2 .M CaO is the molar mass of CaO.\n\nIn order to simplify the calculation model, some assumptions were applied in this study.Firstly, the diffusion front was assumed to be the same as the carbonation front, with the area behind the front being fully carbonated; then, in the slab model, shown as Fig. 2, the carbonation amounts were determined as a function of exposed surface area, carbonation depth and the cement content of concrete.Due to the influence on the carbonation process of the exposure condition and material properties, in this study, for concrete, a compressive-strength-class breakdown was carried out based on the regional standards.For mortar, the different kinds of utilization -rendering, masonry and maintenance -were considered to be most important.Two main exposure conditions (buried and in open air) were considered, with different carbonation coefficients.Specifically, carbon sequestration of these four types of cementitious materials can be found in the Supplement.\n\n\nUncertainty assessment\n\nBased on the kinetic models described in previous sections, in this study, the uncertainty estimations through Monte Carlo simulation are applied in cement process emission and cement carbon uptake separately.The term \"uncertainty\" in this study refers to the lower and upper bounds of a 95 % confidence interval (CI) around our central estimate, i.e. the median.All of the input parameters of activity levels, emission and uptake factors, with corresponding statistical distributions, were fed into a Monte Carlo framework, and 10 000 simulations were performed to analyse the uncertainties in estimated carbon emissions and uptake.The uncertainty ranges of cement process emissions and carbon uptake are in Table S4 (Bing et al., 2023).The previous works (Xi et al., 2016) have illustrated the sources of uncertainties.Coherently with previous studies (Xi et al., 2016;Guo et al., 2021), the annual global cement carbon uptake and emission were obtained from regional or material use aggregation, which include 26 variables and factors, as shown in Table S2 (Bing et al., 2023).Notably, the annual median at a higher level is not equal to the sum of its sub-level components when evaluating the carbon uptake at each level due to the different statistics based on the Monte Carlo simulation results (see https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7516373;Bing et al., 2023;Guo et al., 2021).In this work, for our model used for 2020 and 2021, most of the distributions and their features of variables remain and refer to the previous estimation (Guo et al., 2021).However, the clinker-to-cement ratio of the US is updated based on the USGS cement annual report of 2021, leading to a change where the random errors are within the range of ±5 % (a uniform distribution).Specifically, the clinker ratio was set to range from 75 % to 97 % in a Weibull distribution, with shape and scale parameters of 91.0 % and 25 for regional aggregation of the years 1930-2021.For China and India, the clinker ratio distribution was unchanged for 1930-1989.For China, the range of coefficient values of the clinker ratio was set to 10 %-20 % for 1990-2004 with a normal distribution; for 2004-2021, the random errors were calculated within the range of ±5 % of the mean values with a uniform distribution.For India, the random errors were calculated within the range of ±10 % and ±5 % of the mean values for 1990-2001 and 2002-2001, respectively, with a uniform distribution.\n\nMeanwhile, to discern the relative contributions of distinct parameters to the uncertainty inherent in model predictions, a one-at-a-time (OAT) sensitivity analysis was executed.The OAT methodology involves altering one parameter while maintaining others as constant, thereby isolating and gauging the impact of that particular parameter on the projected outcomes.By comparing the relative influence of various parameters, those that wield a more pronounced effect on model predictions become evident.Within the purview of the OAT analysis conducted here, each parameter was perturbed by +10 % to discern the variables imparting considerable uncertainty to forecasted cement carbon uptake.(Wang et al., 2021).\n\nThe regional contribution of CO 2 emissions from the cement process has been altered over the period 1930-2021.As shown in Fig. 3, the CO 2 emissions from the cement processes in each region show an overall growth trend, while the growth rate varies by country and region.Among all regions, China experienced the most dramatic increasing emission trend, with an annual growth rate of 7.7 % and reaching 0. ), accounting for around 6.2 % of process emissions.China and ROW kept their absolute leader role in cement CO 2 emissions till 2021, but the share of India decreased significantly from ∼ 10 % to 6.2 % in the most recent 2 years, partly because of the shrinkage of the cement market during the COVID pandemic (Schlorke et al., 2020).Meanwhile, according to our calculations, there has been a persistent upward trend in global cement production since 2019, which has led to a corresponding increase in CO 2 emissions during the pandemic period (2020-2021).In 2020, global cement production reached 1590.38 Mt, and this figure rose to 1819.48 Mt in 2021.Notably, the ROW accounted for the highest contribution, with production increasing from 495.75 in 2020 to 725.83 Mt in 2021.The surge in demand for cement in 2021 can be attributed to the recovery from the pandemic, which resulted in the resumption of delayed construction projects (Schlorke et al., 2020).\n\nHowever, it is important to note that China bucked this trend, experiencing a slight decline in cement production from 752.40 in 2019 to 748.64 Mt in 2021, with an intermediate figure of 774.45 Mt in 2020.This deviation can be attributed to China's stringent policy measures and the property crisis that unfolded in 2020 and 2021 (Hale et al., 2022).\n\n\nCement carbon uptake by region and material type\n\nAccording to our estimates, the total global CO 2 uptake by cement reached 0.96 Gt CO 2 (95 % CI: 0.81-1.15Gt CO 2 ) in 2021, with an average annual growth rate of 7.9 %.This means that 30.8 % of CO 2 emission from the cement process in 2021 was offset by cement carbon uptake in that year.It shows that the cement uptake increased fast during around 2000-2013, then the increase rate slowed down due to the changes in cement production.Global cumulative CO 2 uptake by cement was estimated to be 22.90 Gt CO 2 (95 % CI: 19.64-26.64Gt CO 2 ), equivalent to ∼ 55 % of the cumulative emissions over the same period.As we can see in Fig. 4, in China, cement carbon uptake increased from 0.05 Mt in 1930 to 426.77 Mt in 2021; its cumulative uptake reached 7.06 Gt CO 2 (95 % CI: 5.22-9.44Gt CO 2 ), accounting for 30.8 % of global cumulative uptake.The cement carbon uptake in China grew exponentially, while the growth curves in the US and European countries were relatively smooth.This is mainly because the cement demand in China has seen rapid growth in recent decades, while developed countries have been close to saturation after the 1980s.Moreover, concrete structures in developed countries have a longer service life (estimated 70 years).As for the rest of world, the total carbon uptake by cement has also increased significantly (from 0.74 Mt in 1930 to 328.23 Mt in 2021), and the growth trend in these countries was smoother than in China but more dramatic than in the US and Europe.\n\nIn addition, the amount of cement carbon uptake varies depending on the type of cement material.Mortar contributes the largest portion of cement carbon uptake, although its application scale is much less than concrete (∼ 73 % for concrete use and ∼ 24 % for mortar use).This is because mortar, as a building decoration material, has the characteristics of small thickness, large exposed surface area and therefore fast carbonation kinetics.According to Fig. 6, in 2021, the carbon uptakes by mortar and concrete were 536.85 and 325.95 Mt, accounting for 55.6 % and 33.8 % of the total cement carbon uptake respectively.Meanwhile, cement kiln dust (CKD) and loss waste absorbed 62.60 Mt (6.5 %) and 34.97 Mt (3.6 %) CO 2 respectively.\n\n\nFeatures of cement carbon uptake\n\nThe cement uptake in certain years actually consists of two parts, namely the current uptake and the historical uptake.The current uptake refers to the uptake from the year cement is produced and has a close relationship with the current cement production.Historical uptake refers to the uptake accumulated from the year before.The natural carbonation of cement materials is a slow, dynamic process, and, thus, the carbon uptake by cement has obvious time lag effects.As shown in Fig. 7, part of the carbon uptake in a given period was contributed by cement materials in previous periods.This is because the cementitious materials' carbon uptake is a very slow process, leading to a long period being required to accumulate and to manifest; during the demolishment period of cement materials, crushing increases its newly exposed surface area and carbonation rate, allowing the carbon uptake capacity of cement materials to persist for a long time.With this feature, the cement carbon uptake capacity can be affected by the service life of cement buildings, and the average lifetime in China (40 years) is less than in the US and Europe (65-75 years).Therefore, countries such as China, with a higher-speed cement carbonation cycle, can make relatively greater contributions to cement carbon uptake.However, the majority of cement carbon uptake was still attributed to the consumption use stage, providing a ∼ 64 % share in 2021.\n\nWe can also learn from Fig. 6 that the growth rate of historical carbon uptake spiked after the 1990s.It is noteworthy that 75.4 % of the cement carbon uptake has occurred since the 1990s, larger than that of 2019 (71 %).This surge can be explained by the surplus absorption in the demolition phase due to the historically produced cement in European countries during the 1930s and 1940s on the one hand and by the considerably increased demand for cement materials in Earth Syst.Sci.Data, 15, 4947-4958, 2023 https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-4947-2023China after the implementation of the reform and openingup policy on the other hand.\n\nBesides, the offset level (55.1 %) is slightly higher than our previous estimate for 1930-2019 (∼ 52 %) (Guo et al., 2021), mainly due to the rapid increase in demand from ROW during the COVID pandemic (Schlorke et al., 2020).\n\nFigure 7 traces the cumulative cement process CO 2 emissions between 1930 and 2021 according to the regional production and use of cement in different materials and according to the life cycle of each type of material.From a regional perspective, between 1930 and 2021, 6 %, 32 %, 23 %, 6 % and 34 % of CO 2 emissions from cement production were from the United States, China, Europe, India and the rest of the world respectively.For cement material, the CO 2 emissions were 68 % from concrete, 27 % from mortar, 2 % from cement loss during the construction stage and 3 % from CKD generation.The CO 2 emissions can be allocated as follows: 83 % to service life cement, 6 % to demolished cement, and 11 % to demolition cement landfills and recycling.Overall, the emissions during 1930-2021 are sequestered by cement materials, and 43 % remain in atmosphere.\n\nOur series of research into building cement carbon uptake accounting methods and quantitative calculation of its carbon absorption has made up for the lack of methods in the IPCC national greenhouse gas inventory guidelines (IPCC, 2006;Xi et al., 2016) and has provided data and technical support for the precise calculation of the global carbon balance and carbon neutrality.In the global carbon budget report, the impact of cement carbon sequestration on global carbon balance has started to be considered (Friedlingstein et al., 2022).According to the analysis conducted in the present study, the cement materials' annual carbon uptake in 2021 was equivalent to 7.67 % of the global industrial process emissions of CO 2 (Friedlingstein et al., 2022), approximately 8.23 % of the average global land carbon sink from 2010 to 2020 (Friedlingstein et al., 2022)   23.80 % of the average net global forest sink from 1990 to 2007 (Pan et al., 2011).The cement carbon sink of China alone in 2021 was about 0.43 Gt CO 2 yr −1 , which accounts for 48 % to 60 % of the terrestrial carbon sink in China during the past decades (Yang et al., 2022), with the substantial cement carbon sequestration making it one of the important carbon sinks that cannot be ignored in the national and global carbon cycle and carbon neutrality evaluation.Meanwhile, the carbonization of cement materials is considered to be one of the most promising technologies for carbon dioxide capture and storage.Scientists and engineers have been inspired by the carbonization effect of cement to develop carbon capture, utilization and storage technologies (CCUS) by using construction waste (Skocek et al., 2020;Hargis et al., 2021).Certainly, the CCUS technology of mineralization is technically feasible, but further research is still needed to reduce economic costs and to identify suitable application department scenarios.In the future, use of alkaline mineral carbon sequestration to achieve emission reductions will play an important role in achieving carbon neutrality goals (Chiang and Pan, 2017;Hargis et al., 2021).\n\n\nUncertainty analysis\n\nThe estimates of cement carbon uptake and emissions underwent thorough uncertainty analysis utilizing Monte Carlo simulations.The findings reveal that the 95 % confidence interval for cumulative carbon uptake spanning from 1930 to 2021 ranges from 19.6 to 26.6 Gt CO 2 , while the cumula-tive emissions exhibit a range of 38.7 to 47.2 Gt CO 2 , as presented in Table S4.\n\nThrough executing an OAT sensitivity analysis that uses China's carbon uptake simulation as an illustrative case (Fig. 8), overall, the main influential parameters can be categorized as cement material properties, carbonation efficiency parameters and environmental factors.Notably, cement material properties encompassing factors such as clinker-tocement ratio (100 %), correction factors related to cement additives (96.1 %) and CaO content in clinker (90.9 %) exerted the most substantial influence, given their direct impact on the scale of carbon uptake.Carbonation efficiency parameters encompassing the proportions of CaO converted to CaCO 3 for concrete and mortar introduced significant uncertainty at levels of 57.2 % and 38.9 % respectively.This underscores the pivotal role that carbonation efficiency uncertainty plays in determining outcomes.Environmental factors primarily encapsulated by the CO 2 concentration correction factor were responsible for 88.2 % of the uncertainty in predictions.Consequently, ambient CO 2 levels exercise a notable sway over the degree of result uncertainty.The uncertainty analysis provides a quantitative basis for assessing the influence of different factors on carbon uptake.Further collection of measured data and improving the certainty of key parameters in the future will help reduce result uncertainty and improve estimation accuracy.\n\nFurthermore, in order to establish the validity of this study, we attempted cross-validation.Generally, the coverage of the global cement carbonation uptake within the existing research is limited, with only a handful of studies (Xi et al., 2016;Guo et al., 2021;Cao et al., 2020) delving into this area.The majority of research focuses solely on specific regions, like Spain (Sanjuán et al., 2020) or the Nordic countries (Pade and Guimaraes, 2007) or particular structures, such as the Itaipu Dam (Possan et al., 2017).Moreover, there is a notable discrepancy in the methodologies employed among studies that share similar scopes.Notably, the iterative updating approach is utilized in various studies but with distinct variations.For instance, Guo's research method builds upon the foundation established by Xi's work, a progression that Guo elaborates upon in their paper (Guo et al., 2021).\n\n\nData availability\n\nAll the original datasets used for estimating the emissions and uptake in this study and the resulting datasets themselves from the simulation, as well as the associated uncertainties, are made available on Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7516373(Bing et al., 2023).\n\nEarth Syst.Sci.Data, 15, 4947-4958, 2023 https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-4947-2023\n\n\nConclusions\n\nDue to the unique characteristics of carbon uptake by cement, it is imperative to conduct a scientific and comprehensive estimation of cement carbon uptake.This is crucial for accurately assessing the environmental impact of the cement industry and for supporting global carbon neutrality goals.From a kinetic standpoint, cement carbon uptake is a dynamic process that occurs during various stages, including production and/or consumption, demolition, and reuse.Therefore, it is highly significant to incorporate historical cement legacy sequestration and to utilize dynamic clinker ratios to enhance the comprehensiveness and accuracy of estimations.Our objective in this study is to update our data in the temporal dimension while maintaining consistency with our previous work in terms of methodology.Updating the data within the same framework will enhance the completeness of our database, thereby providing a reliable data foundation for our future forecasting endeavours.\n\nBased on our estimations, the cumulative carbon uptake by cement materials from 1930 to 2021 amounts to 22.90 Gt CO 2 (with a 95 % confidence interval, CI: 19.64-26.64Gt CO 2 ).Mortar contributes approximately 58.5 % to the total uptake, effectively offsetting 55.1 % of the cumulative process emissions.\n\nThis dataset and estimation methodology can be employed as a valuable set of tools for evaluating cement carbon emissions and uptake throughout the dynamic processes encompassing the entire cement life cycle.While per capita cement stocks in Europe and the United States are reaching saturation levels, China has emerged as the dominant region in cement production and consumption following the implementation of China's reform and opening-up policy.Considering that cement demand in China and other developing countries is expected to continue increasing, it becomes evident that this trend will impact the assessment of global carbon neutrality.Therefore, it is crucial to make further efforts to improve the accuracy of cement carbon uptake estimation by incorporating direct clinker production data and experimentally derived, spatially resolved conversion factors.\n\nSupplement.The

India has experienced an incremental growth trend inrecent years, totally emitting 2.56 Gt CO 2 (95 % CI: 2.33-3.02 Gt CO 2\nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-4947-2023EarthSyst.Sci.Data, 15, 4947-4958, 2023\n\nEarth Syst.

Unravelling the bovine colostrumlactationmature milk proteomicsprotein ingredient\nBovine colostrum (BC) and mature bovine milk are highly nutritious.In addition to being consumed by adults, these dairy products are also used as protein ingredients for infant formula.However, the differences in the nutritional composition of BC and mature milk, especially regarding proteins present in trace amounts, have not been comprehensively studied.Furthermore, the distinct proteomic profiles of mature milk derived from the first lactation (Milk-L1) and the second lactation (Milk-L2) are not fully understood.To address these gaps, this study aims to uncover the subtle differences in protein compositions of BC, Milk-L1, and Milk-L2 by proteomics.Compared with BC, anti-microbial proteins β-defensins and bovine hemoglobin subunit were up-regulated in Milk-L1, while Milk-L2 exhibited higher levels of enteric β-defensin, sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1, sydecan-2, and cysteine-rich secretory protein 2. Additionally, immune proteins such as vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 4B, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR), and Ig-like domain-containing protein were found at higher levels in Milk-L1 compared with Milk-L2.The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the distinct proteomic profiles of BC, Milk-L1, and Milk-L2, which contributes to the development of protein ingredients for infant formula.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBovine colostrum, the initial milk produced by cows in the first three days after parturition, is known to be rich in proteins, growth factors, immunoglobulins, and other bioactive compounds [1].As lactation progresses, a transition from colostrum to mature milk occurs, during which the protein composition is significantly changed.Mature milk, in general, lacks the high levels of immunoregulatory compounds which are present in bovine colostrum, including immunoglobulins, hormones, growth factors, and cytokine [2].However, it contains relatively high levels of casein, which can be further hydrolyzed, releasing casein-derived bioactive peptides and various essential amino acids [3].Owing to the potent bioactivities of bovine colostrum and mature milk, they are considered important protein ingredients in the manufacturing of infant formula.Skim milk powder, processed from mature milk, is typically used as the casein source for infant formula, and by mixing it with whey protein concentrate (WPC), infant formula can mimic the casein-to-whey ratio and major nutrients present in human milk [4].Furthermore, the supplementation of bovine colostrum to infants improves the digestive and absorptive functions, and ameliorates gut inflammation via the recovery of systemic immunity [5].Although several studies have investigated the proteomic profiles of bovine colostrum [6][7][8] and mature milk [9,10] individually, there is a dearth of research into the comparison of these profiles to reveal the delicate differences in proteins enriched in each milk type.Therefore, it is of great importance to uncover and compare the protein profiles of bovine colostrum and mature milk, which may provide a better understanding of the nutritional values of infant formula, and also contribute to the development of infant formula with superior nutritional quality.\n\nWith regard to mature milk, the protein compositions can vary a lot between the first and second parities, which directly affects their nutritional values [11].It has been reported that the total protein yield is increased in the second lactation of Holstein dairy cows, potentially owing to the development of the mammary gland and the regulation of hormones [12].However, little is known about the specific changes in protein compositions in these two types of mature milk.Existing reports have found that the casein-to-whey ratios could shift during lactations, leading to a lower level of casein in the mature milk from the first lactation compared with the second lactation [13].Furthermore, the colostrum proteins, including immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, and growth factors, may be more abundant in the mature milk from the first lactation [14].Nevertheless, detailed information is lacking regarding the presence of other potentially functional proteins beyond those that have been extensively reported, such as casein, β-lactoglobulin, immunoglobulins, and lactoferrin.Hence, a systematic profiling of proteins is needed to elaborate on the subtle differences between mature milk from the first and second lactations, thereby shedding light on how each protein changes during lactations.\n\nNowadays, mass spectrometry-based proteomics are widely adopted in various research fields, such as clinical research, disease treatment, drug characterization, and nutrition [15].As a high-throughput and high-sensitivity technique, proteomics allows for a comprehensive comparison of protein profiles among samples with the aid of multivariate statistical analyses.In the present study, a proteomics technique was employed, considering that various cytokines, growth factors, or other bioactive compounds with relatively low concentrations may be found inside bovine colostrum and mature milk.Therefore, this study aimed to uncover and compare the proteomic profiles of bovine colostrum and mature milk from the first and second lactations via mass spectrometry-based proteomics, thereby screening out the differentially expressed functional proteins and figuring out how they vary during lactations.This study provides valuable insights into the selection of ideal protein ingredients for infant formula.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nSample Information\n\nThe samples were obtained from the Experimental Farm of Yangzhou University, Jiangsu, China.Bovine colostrum (BC) was collected during the first 3 days, from the 2nd to 4th of September, 2020, after the cow had given birth to her first calf.Mature milk from the first lactation (Milk-L1) was obtained 20 days after the birth of the first calf, on the 18th of September, 2020.Mature milk from the second lactation (Milk-L2) was collected 20 days after the birth of the second calf, on the 3rd of December, 2021.Protein contents of the samples were measured immediately after collection by the experimental farm: BC 10% (m/v), Milk-L1 3.5% (m/v), Milk-L2 3.5% (m/v).After that, the milk samples were collected in 9 500 mL plastic bottles and stored in an ice-filled foam box for transportation.All the samples were transported to the laboratory within 6 h.Upon arrival, samples were allocated into 50 mL falcon tubes and stored at −60 • C.\n\n\nThe Protein Composition Visualized Using SDS-PAGE\n\nSodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed on all samples in triplicate.Samples were diluted 10 times with LDS sample buffer (4x, Invitrogen, Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA) to avoid overloading and heated at 80 • C for 10 min.Five µL of each sample was loaded in each well of a precast 12% Bis-Tris gel (Nu-PAGE, Thermo, USA).Proteins were separated at 150 V with NuPAGE MES SDS running buffer (Thermo, USA) for 1 h.Proteins were stained with 0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 solution in 85% phosphoric acid, ammonium sulphate (150 mg/mL), and 96% ethanol.\n\nThe gels were destained in Milli-Q water and scanned using an Epson Perfection V750 Pro scanner (Seiko Epson Corporation, Nagano, Japan).\n\n\nMass Spectrometry-Based Proteomic Analysis\n\nThe proteins from 3 biological replicates of BC, Milk-L1, and Milk-L2 (100 µL, respectively) were extracted by 400 µL of cold acetone and thereafter redissolved in 8 M urea/100 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0).The solution was centrifuged (12,000× g, 4 • C) for 15 min and the supernatant was obtained.Ten mM of dithiothreitol was added and the solution was incubated at 37 • C for 1 h.Afterwards, 40 mM of iodoacetamide was added to permanently block the disulfide bond.The protein contents of samples were detected based on the Bradford method [16] and then normalized to 1 mg/mL.Trypsin (V5071, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was added at a ratio of 50:1 (w/w) and the solution was incubated at 37 • C overnight.The pH of the solution was adjusted to 6.0 with trifluoroacetic acid to terminate the trypsin digestion.Finally, the supernatant was centrifuged again (12,000 rpm, 4 • C) for 3 min, and the newly obtained supernatant was collected for LC-MS/MS analysis, where the LC-ESI-MS/MS system (UPLC, EASY-nLC 1200, Thermo Scientific, MA, USA; MS, Orbitrap Exploris 480, Thermo Scientific, MA, USA) was applied.The analytical conditions were as follows: UPLC column, 50 µm × 150 mm, 2 µm particle size, 100 Å pore size, Acclaim PepMap C18 column, Thermo; column temperature, 40 • C; flow rate, 0.4 mL/min; injection volume, 5 µL; solvent system, water (0.1% formic acid): acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid); gradient program, 95:5 v/v at 0 min, 10:90 v/v at 10.0 min, 10:90 v/v at 11.0 min, 95:5 v/v at 11.1 min, 95:5 v/v at 14.0 min.The ESI source operation parameters were as follows: source temperature, 500 • C; ion spray voltage (IS), 5500 V (positive) or −4500 V (negative); ion source gas I, gas II and curtain gas were set at 50, 50, and 25 Psi, respectively; the collision gas was set as high.The raw data were extracted by DIA-Umpire software (v2.2.8) [17] and MSFragger (v3.8) [18] was used for matching the data to a known bovine protein database, Uniprot.Proteome.Bovine.20200629.fasta.All the settings of MSFragger were set to default except for the variable modifications, which were 'Oxidation (M), Acetyl (Protein N-term)', and the fixed modification was 'Carbamidomethyl (C)' and the digestion enzyme was 'Trypsin'.\n\n\nMultivariate Statistical Analyses\n\nProtein intensities were log 2 -transformed for statistical analysis to improve normality.All the proteins were used for hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) with Perseus [19].Unsupervised PCA (principal component analysis) was performed using statistics function prcomp within R (www.r-project.org,accessed on 20 March 2023).The R package was also used for the hierarchical cluster analysis.Differentially expressed proteins were selected based on absolute Log 2 FC (fold change: the ion intensity of the protein in experimental group/the ion intensity of the protein in control group) > 2 and p < 0.05.The differentially expressed proteins were then annotated and enriched using the Kyoto encyclopedia gene and genome (KEGG) compound database (http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/compound/,accessed on 20 March 2023).\n\n\nResults\n\n\nThe Distribution of Proteins in Bovine\n\nColostrum and Mature Milk from the First and Second Lactations SDS-PAGE was performed in BC, Milk-L1, and Milk-L2 (Figure 1).High molecular weight protein aggregates (bands > 180 kDa) were observed in BC and Milk-L1, but were absent in Milk-L2.The streaking region (75-100 kDa) which corresponded to lactoferrin (~80 kDa)/lactoperoxidase (~78 kDa) was observed in BC and Milk-L1, with the band intensity in BC higher than that in Milk-L1.The bands 60-75 kDa, which may refer to BSA (bovine serum albumin, ~66 kDa), were observed in all the samples.The bands with a molecular weight slightly below 60 kDa could be the heavy chain of immunoglobulin G (~55 kDa), and the band intensity followed the pattern BC > Milk-L1 > Milk-L2.\n\nAdditionally, caseins were separated in bands within the range between 25 and 35 kDa, and whey proteins, including β-lactoglobulin (18.4 kDa) and α-lactalbumin (14 kDa), were observed in all the samples.The band intensities of caseins followed the pattern Milk-L2 > BC > Milk-L1.\n\n(~80 kDa)/lactoperoxidase (~78 kDa) was observed in BC

followed the pattern Milk-L2 > BC > Milk-L1.\n\n\nMultivariate Statistical Analyses of Bovine Colostrum and Mature Milk from the First and Second Lactations\n\nMultivariate statistical analyses were performed to assess the differences between the proteomic profiles of BC, Milk-L1, and Milk-L2.Principal component analysis (PCA) was firstly applied to investigate the internal structure of multiple variables according to different principal components.The result indicated that the three types of milk were divided into three distinct groups with principal component 1 (PC1) at 58.05% and principal component 2 (PC2) at 27.96% (Figure 2A).BC was clearly separated by PC1, while Milk-L1 was discriminated by PC2.\n\nIn total, 749 proteins were detected by mass spectrometry in the present study.The overall proteomic differences of different groups were further visualized by hierarchical clustering analysis, where three major clusters were obtained (Figure 2B).The result indicated that cluster 3 contained the most proteins, where the average intensity of the heat map followed the pattern BC < Milk-L1 < Milk-L2.\n\n\nMultivariate Statistical Analyses of Bovine Colostrum and Mature Milk from

Milk-L2.\n\n\nComparison of the Proteomic Profiles of Bovine Colostrum and Mature Milk from the First Lactation\n\nThere were 458 up-regulated and 13 down-regulated proteins in Milk-L1 compared with BC (Figure 3A).Among these, the most up-regulated proteins included procollagen galactosyltransferase 1, hemoglobin subunit β, α-actinin-4, β-defensin 8, and enteric βdefensin.However, Ig-like domain-containing protein, transcription factor E2F6, pentraxinrelated protein PTX3, and inter-α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H3 were down-regulated, and thus showed higher levels in BC (Figure 3B).All the differentially expressed proteins between BC and Milk-L1 were then mapped to the KEGG database to reveal the related biological pathways.The differentially expressed proteins were mainly involved in the pathways of human diseases, including shigellosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and pathogenic E. coli infection (Figure 3C).\n\n\nComparison of the Proteomic Profiles of Bovine

Lactation\n\nIn the comparison of Milk-L2 and BC (control), 458 proteins were found to be upregulated, while 13 proteins were down-regulated (Figure 4A).According to the fold change, the most up-regulated proteins were SEA domain-containing protein, sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1, syndecan-2, cysteine-rich secretory protein 2, and enteric β-defensin.However, vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 4B, PIGR kazal-like domain containing protein, and ephrin-A1 were among the most down-regulated proteins (Figure 4B).The differentially expressed proteins were also mostly involved in the pathways of human diseases, including salmonella infection and pathogenic E. col infection (Figure 4C).\n\n\nComparison of the Proteomic Profiles of Bovine Colostrum

of Mature Milk from the First and Second Lac\n\nRegarding the comparison between Milk-L1 (control) and Milk-L2, 172 prote down-regulated, whereas 169 proteins were up-regulated (Figure 5A).Milk-L1 e higher levels of vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 4B, PIGR, fatty acid protein 5, Ig-like domain-containing protein, and heterogeneous nuclear ribonu tein A1, while Milk-L2 showed higher levels of sterol regulatory element bind scription factor 1, transcription factor E2F6, syndecan-2, zinc finger protein CCC and PHD finger protein 3 (Figure 5B).The KEGG analysis revealed that the diffe expressed proteins were mainly involved in the ECM (extracellular matrix)-rec teraction and the AMPK signaling pathways (Figure 5C).\n\n\nComparison of the Proteomic Profiles of Mature Milk from

comprehensive comparison between the proteomic profiles of bovine colostrum and mature milk is needed to shed light on the specific nutrition that can be provided to infants.Additionally, the biological pathways annotated by the differentially regulated proteins may indicate the potential biological functions of bovine colostrum and mature milk.\n\nSDS-PAGE was first conducted in order to reveal the distribution of the major proteins present in bovine colostrum and mature milk from the first and second lactations.According to the results of protein separation, some protein aggregates and streaking regions were observed in BC and Milk-L1.This could have resulted from improper storage during transportation, where heat load induced the aggregation of milk proteins through either covalent binding or hydrophobic interactions [20].However, these aggregated proteins had no effect on the following proteomic analysis due to the urea, dithiothreitol, and iodoacetamide pre-treatments.BC contained more IgG (in both aggregated form and heavy chain form) and lactoferrin than Milk-L1, while Milk-L2 had limited amounts of these large proteins.This result was in line with the findings of Goldsmith et al., who indicated that total immunoglobulins and lactoferrin were decreased significantly with the increase in postpartum time [21].After birth, newborn calves are exposed to a massive invasion of potentially harmful pathogens from the environment and the immunoglobulins provided by bovine colostrum play important roles in the calves' innate immune defense.Moreover, IgG, the major type of immunoglobulin in bovine colostrum, has proven to be a promising supplement in specialized dairy products, supporting immune function in vulnerable groups such as infants, children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients [22].The casein-to-whey ratio was significantly changed during lactations, as Milk-L2 had a higher casein-to-whey ratio than Milk-L1, which was in line with previous findings that the mammary gland is more mature and efficient at milk synthesis during the second lactation [13,23,24].\n\nFollowing the general protein differences uncovered by SDS-PAGE, proteomics was conducted to analyze the delicate differences between the protein profiles of the different milk types.During the transition from BC to Milk-L1, proteins were mostly up-regulated, including procollagen galactosyltransferase 1, hemoglobin subunit β, α-actinin-4, β-defensin 8, and enteric β-defensin.The result revealed that enteric β-defensins were significantly accumulated in mature milk, relative to bovine colostrum.β-Defensins are antimicrobial peptides primarily expressed by leukocytes and epithelial cells at mucosal surfaces.In bovine milk, β-defensins act as a part of the bovine innate immune system and the first line of defense against bovine mastitis [25].The significant antimicrobial activity of β-defensins can facilitate both innate and adaptive immune responses in humans [26].In addition, the bovine hemoglobin subunit which accumulated in Milk-L1 also exhibited potent antimicrobial activity in humans.Although the entire hemoglobin molecule showed no direct antibacterial activity, its fragments, the hemoglobin derived peptides, were bioactive as they not only exhibited an inhibitory effect on E. coli and S. aureus, but also took part in wound healing processes at injured sites [27].Therefore, the anti-microbial proteins were up-regulated in Milk-L1 compared with BC.However, BC contained elevated levels of several anti-inflammatory proteins, including pentraxin-related protein PTX3 and interα-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H3.PTX3, a pattern recognition molecule involved in innate immune responses, is able to cooperate with the adaptive immune system in defense inflammation via developing a protective Th1/T reg immune response and inhibiting a harmful Th17/Th2 immune response [28,29].Similarly, inter-α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H3 is a plasma protein associated with inflammation and tumorigenic and metastatic processes.Normally, this protein is linked to hyaluronic acid to maintain extracellular matrix stability.The dysregulation of inter-α-trypsin inhibitor protein can lead to inflammation and promote tumor development [30].In addition, Ig-like domain-containing protein, which regulates the immune response against inflammation, was unsurprisingly more abundant in BC.Additionally, the result of KEGG annotation further confirmed that the anti-microbial related pathways, such as shigellosis and pathogenic E. coli infection, were enriched during the transition from BC to Milk-L1.\n\nRegarding the comparison between Milk-L2 and BC, the anti-microbial protein enteric β-defensin also accumulated in mature milk from the second lactation, which was in accordance with the result from the comparison between Milk-L1 and BC.Moreover, sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1, the key transcription factor for the nutritional induction of lipogenic enzyme genes, exhibited a significantly higher level in Milk-L2 compared with BC.A similar result was observed in [31], which indicated that the sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 in mature milk facilitates a healthier fatty acid composition by modulating the amount of lauric acid (12:0) and myristic acid (14:0).Milk-L2 also contained a significantly higher level of sydecan-2 compared with BC.Sydecan-2 plays important roles in neuronal development and functions as a tumor suppressor regulating the apoptotic signaling in bone tumors [32].In addition, another functional protein, cysteine-rich secretory protein 2, was detected in Milk-L2.Cysteine-rich secretory proteins are key players in mammalian fertilization and fertility, having Ca 2+ channel regulatory abilities [33].To our knowledge, the present study is the first to report the detection of cysteine-rich secretory protein 2 in milk, despite this protein being predominately secreted by arthropods.In BC, immunoregulatory proteins PIGR and kazal-like domain-containing protein were dominant.PIGR is able to transport immunoglobulin A across the epithelial cell layer into mucosal and glandular surfaces of mammals, such as the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, urogenital tract, and the mammary glands, thereby protecting against different infections [34].Kazal-like domain containing protein is a member of the insulin growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBP) which regulate the bioavailability and function of insulin growth factors [35].Like PIGR and immunoglobulins, insulin growth factors are important immunomodulatory proteins in BC, showing a significant protective effect for infant health.A human study confirmed a positive correlation between the body weight of a 1-year-old infant and concentrations of insulin growth factor-I in the milk from the diet [36].In addition, compared with Milk-L2, BC also contained higher levels of vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 4B and ephrin-A1, which both control the signaling transduction in tumor formation [37,38].\n\nMature milk is not only consumed by adults, but is also regarded as an important protein ingredient in infant formula.The skim milk powder processed from mature milk can balance the casein-to-whey ratio and provide various nutrients for infants.However, the protein composition of mature milk varied between parities.In comparison to Milk-L2, Milk-L1 contained higher levels of vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 4B, PIGR, and Ig-like domain-containing protein, which were also abundant in BC.This indicated that the mature milk from the first lactation still had several immune proteins in common with BC.The result was in line with [39], which demonstrated that milk from the second lactation contains the lowest immunological composition.This could potentially be explained by the fact that first-lactation cows have a less pronounced negative energy balance and stable metabolic profiles, while second-lactation cows experience more immune reactions where proteins are consumed for the development of the mammary glands [12].However, functional proteins sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (able to regulate fatty acid composition) and syndecan-2 (anti-tumor) were of higher levels in Milk-L2 compared in Milk-L1.In addition, a high level of zinc finger protein CCCHtype endowed Milk-L2 with an anti-inflammatory effect [40].KEGG annotation revealed the major pathways that Milk-L2 was involved in.The enrichment of the ECM-receptor interaction pathway may indicate the occurrence of elevated immune reactions, while the detection of the AMPK signaling pathway provided evidence for energy consumption in Milk-L2.Therefore, in contrast to the increased levels of immune proteins in Milk-L1, Milk-L2 contained a wider range of proteins with diverse bioactivities, including antiinflammation, anti-tumor, and fatty acid regulation.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nThe proteomic profiles of bovine colostrum, and mature milk from the first and second lactations were revealed and compared in the present study.Our results indicated that BC contained more IgG and lactoferrin than Milk-L1, while Milk-L2 had the lowest levels of these proteins.However, Milk-L2 had a higher casein-to-whey ratio than Milk-L1 and BC.In comparison to BC, anti-microbial proteins enteric β-defensin, β-defensin 8 and bovine hemoglobin subunit were up-regulated in Milk-L1, while Milk-L2 exhibited higher levels of enteric β-defensin, sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1, sydecan-2, and cysteine-rich secretory protein 2. In addition, Milk-L1 contained increased levels of immune proteins, such as vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 4B, PIGR, and Ig-like domain-containing protein, compared with Milk-L2.However, Milk-L2 exhibited a protein profile with diverse bioactivities, including anti-inflammation, anti-tumor, and fatty acid regulation properties.In summary, this study provides valuable insight into the delicate differences between the proteomic profiles of bovine colostrum and mature milk from the first and second lactations, thereby contributing to the development of ideal protein ingredients for infant formula.\n\nFigure 1 .\n1\nFigure 1.SDS-PAGE of proteins of bovine colostrum and milk from the first and second lactations; M: protein marker, BC: bovine colostrum, Milk-L1/2: mature milk from the first/second lactation.\n\n\nFigure 1 .\n1\nFigure 1.SDS-PAGE of proteins of bovine colostrum and milk from the first and second lactations; M: protein marker, BC: bovine colostrum, Milk-L1/2: mature milk from the first/second lactation.\n\n\nFoods 2023 ,Figure 2 .\n20232\nFigure 2.

2023 Accepted: 3 November 2023cysteaminecystinosiseye dropsophthalmic administration\nBackground: Cystinosis is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of cystine crystals in several tissues and organs causing, among others, severe eye symptoms.The high instability of cysteamine eye drops makes it difficult to develop formulations with an acceptable shelf life to be prepared in hospital pharmacy departments.Previously, a new compounded formulation of cysteamine eye drops in hyaluronic acid (HA) packaged in innovative single-dose systems was developed.Methods: Long-term stability at −20 • C of this formulation was studied considering the content of cysteamine, pH, osmolality, viscosity, and microbiological analysis.The oxygen permeability of single-dose containers was also studied and an ocular biopermanence study was conducted in healthy volunteers measuring lacrimal stability and volume parameters.Results: Data confirm that cysteamine concentration remained above 90% for 120 days, all parameters remaining within the accepted range for ophthalmic formulations.The permeability of the containers was reduced over time, while ocular biopermanence was maintained despite the freezing process and storage time.Conclusions: 0.55% cysteamine hydrochloride formulation in HA and packaged in single-dose containers preserved at −20 • C is stable for 120 days protected from light, presenting high potential for its translation into clinical practice when commercial presentations are not available.\n\nIntroduction\n\nCystinosis is a rare lysosomal disease characterized by intralysosomal accumulation of cystine crystals, causing damage to various organs and tissues, particularly kidneys and eyes [1,2].This accumulation process is caused by mutations in the CTNS (17p13) gene, which encodes cystinosin, the transporter that carries cystine out of lysosomes [3,4].Cysteamine lowers intracellular levels of cystine by forming a cysteamine-cysteine mixed disulfide, which resembles lysine and leaves the lysosome using alternative cationic transporters [5,6].Cysteamine reacts easily with oxygen to form a disulfide called cystamine, ineffective in the treatment of cystinosis [7][8][9].The fact that cystinosis is a rare disease arouses limited interest in the pharmaceutical industry, so developments in recent years have been scarce.To date, oral formulations have been marketed, such as Cystagon ® and Procysbi ® [10][11][12], with low ophthalmic cysteamine bioavailability, leading to the development of ophthalmic formulations.Cystaran ® 0.44% eye drops, received the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2012 as an orphan drug [13] and, later, Cystadrops ® 0.55% was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the FDA in 2017 and 2021, respectively.\n\nCommercial cysteamine eye drops are not always available in all countries as there are sometimes delays to required procedures and licensing.In this case, Hospital Pharmacy Departments (HPD) are responsible for the elaboration of ophthalmic cysteamine formulations as an alternative therapeutic option [14].Prior to translation to clinical practice, characterization and stability studies are required to guarantee adequate galenic properties, being its extreme instability the main problem for their development [14,15].Oxygen removal, adding antioxidants, reducing the pH, and lowering the temperature in storage, have been shown to effectively increase cysteamine stability [16][17][18][19].Choosing a suitable vehicle is also important, as higher viscosity enhances precorneal residence time and reduces nasolacrimal drainage, increasing the ocular bioavailability of the active ingredients and reducing the frequency of administration [20].In this regard, sodium carboxymethylcellulose was the main advantage provided by Cystadrops ® over Cystaran ® , offering greater ocular surface permanence and more convenient dosage.This excipient provides high viscosity, improving residence time on the ocular surface and allowing its administration four times a day instead of once every hour as with Cystaran ® [21 -23].Hyaluronic acid (HA) as a vehicle has great advantages due to its viscosity, and mucoadhesive and biocompatible properties [24,25].Bearing this in mind, a new compounded formulation of 0.55% cysteamine hydrochloride eye drops in HA packaged in innovative single-dose systems has been previously developed by our group [26].Results showed that this formulation stored at 2-8 • C was stable for less than a week, while when stored at −20 • C, a stability of at least 30 days was reached.Saturation of the solution with nitrogen showed no additional stability.In addition, ocular biopermanence preclinical studies were conducted using positron emission tomography (PET), concluding that the ocular surface permanence offered by the HA is not affected by the reduction in viscosity derived from freezing process, where a half-life of 31.11min for a HA formulation stored for 30 days at −20 • C was obtained, compared with 14.63 min for 0.9% sodium chloride eye drops [26].\n\nThe development of this formulation was a breakthrough for patients and HPD.Knowing its maximum period of stability would allow its translation into clinical practice, allowing the treatment to be dispensed for longer periods and reducing the number of visits to the hospital and the workload of HPD.The present study aimed to determine the previously developed cysteamine compounded formulation [26]: (1) the maximum stability period in terms of chemical, physical, and microbiological stability, as well as to evaluate packaging oxygen permeability and how it is affected by the freeze-thaw process; and, (2) the clinical ocular surface permanence in terms of tear stability and volume in healthy volunteers to confirm the previous preclinical results.\n\nAs described in our previous work [26], cysteamine was dissolved in 10% v/v BSS ® with magnetic stirring, and then sufficient AQ was added diluent to achieve a cysteamine hydrochloride concentration of 0.55%.Sterilizing filtration was performed with a 0.22 µm membrane filter (vacuum-driven bottles FPR204250 PES 0.22 µm; Biofil, Alicante, Spain) under vacuum [26].Cysteamine solutions were elaborated in triplicate.Under sterile conditions in a horizontal laminar flow cabinet, single-dose systems were filled with 30 mL of each formulation by first evacuating the air contained inside using the coupled syringe, connections, and filters according to the manufacturer's instructions [27,28].Finally, each single-dose container was sealed with a Qseal ® -opti heat-sealing equipment (Conroy Medical ® , Upplands Väsby, Sweden) and individually checked.\n\n\nLong-Term Stability Study\n\nOnce the formulations were prepared, single-dose vials were stored protected from light in a freezer (−20 • C) for 120 days.Every 30 days, vials were thawed, and physical and chemical properties were determined, stopping the study when the cysteamine concentration fell below 90% of the initial concentration.Studies were performed in triplicate.All samples were kept at room temperature for at least 30 min once thawed prior to analysis to avoid measurement errors due to temperature variations.Table 1 shows the experimental design

Quantification\n\nCysteamine was quantified by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UH-PLC) as described in our previous work [26], with a UHPLC coupled to photodiode array detection (PDA), using an ACQUITY UPLC H-Class System (Waters ® , Milford, MA, USA) with ACQUITY PDA detector (Waters ® ).An ACQUITY ® BEH C18 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.7 µm, Waters ® ) at a temperature of 45 • C was employed.The mobile phase was a mixture of aqueous 4 mM sodium 1-heptane sulfonate: acetonitrile, in gradient mode as previously described [26].The wavelength used for the detection of cysteamine was 215 nm, respectively.Data were collected and processed with Empower 3 Software (2002-2019 Waters ® ) Application Manager.\n\nAll test samples were diluted 1:50 with 0.1% acetic acid and analyzed by UHPLC setting the injection volume to 5 µL.\n\n\nDetermination of pH and Osmolality\n\nTo determine the pH of the formulation, a BasiC20 ® pH meter (CRISON ® , L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Spain) was used and, to measure the osmolality, 150 µL aliquots of the formulation were introduced in a cryofreezing point osmometer (OsmoSpecial 1; Scharlab ® , Sentmenat, Spain).Each assay was performed in triplicate on day 0 (unfrozen formulation) and at days 30, 60, 90 and 120 post-freezing (Table 1).\n\n\nViscosity Tests\n\nThe viscosity of cysteamine in HA eye drops was determined in triplicate on days 0 (unfrozen formulation) and at days 30, and 120 post-freezing with a rotational viscometer (ViscoQC 300 with PTD 80 Peltier Temperature; Anton Paar ® , Madrid, Spain) (Table 1).For this, 2 mL of each formulation was introduced into the equipment, and the measurement was carried out at 25 • C and 100 revolutions per minute (rpm).\n\n\nMicrobiological Stability\n\nEach replicate was analyzed on day 0 (unfrozen formulation) and at days 60 and 120 post-freezing to determine microbiological stability (Table 1).Aliquots of 1.5 mL were added to plates containing blood agar, Sabouraud agar, and fluid thioglycolate medium.Afterward, media were incubated aerobically at 37 • C; thioglycollate for 10 days, and blood and Sabouraud agar plates for 48 h.Sabouraud agar plates were subsequently incubated for 13 days in aerobiosis at room temperature.\n\n\nSingle-Dose Oxygen Transmission Rate\n\nTo determine whether oxygen transmission through the single doses is affected after the freeze-thaw process, measurements were made of the oxygen transmission rate (OTR) at day 0 (unfrozen formulation) and at days 30 and 120 post-freezing (Table 1).OTR of the walls of the single-dose vials was measured using an OX-TRAN, 1/50 G, Mocon system (Mocon Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the specifications described in ASTM D-3985 [29].A single sample was used for analysis on each of the test days.Single-dose containers were previously thawed and emptied and subsequently cut to obtain a film with a thickness of 1.00 ± 0.01 mm, measured with a digital precision gauge model 3050 from Baxlo (Barcelona, Spain).Samples were introduced into the equipment cell using a mask with a test area of 5 cm 2 .The temperature of the cell was 23 • C. One side of the film was exposed to a stream of dry oxygen at a relative humidity of 1% and a pressure of 32 psi, initiating the diffusion of oxygen molecules into the film.OTR was calculated by counting the molecules passing through the membrane every 20 min.The permeated molecules were delivered to the counting section of the device, equipped with a coulometric sensor, by dry nitrogen (carrier gas), which was continuously purged at 32 psi throughout the test.The tests continued and a steady line of transmission rate in continuous mode was obtained (OTR in cm 3 m −2 day −1 ).\n\n\nOcular Surface Permanence Study in Healthy Volunteers\n\nIn order to demonstrate the behavior of the formulation on the ocular surface, a study of tear meniscus height (TMH) and non-invasive tear keratograph breakup time (NIKBUT) was performed with OCULUS Keratograph 5M ® (Oculus, Wetzlar, Germany) and Oculus TF-Scan module (Oculus, Wetzlar, Germany).TMH is the distance between the uppermost edge of the lower eyelid and the upper limit of the lacrimal meniscus, while NIKBUT reflects the time elapsed from the last complete blink to the first tear film breakup [30,31].An ocular surface permanence clinical study was conducted in 10 healthy volunteers (20 eyes) at the Optometry Clinic of the Optometry Faculty of the Universidade de Santiago de Compostela.The inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Table S1 of the supplementary material.To mitigate the influence of diurnal variations in tear parameters or interexaminer influence, all measurements were conducted within the same time window (09:00-12:00 a.m.) by the same investigator across all sessions and patients [32][33][34], and with environmental conditions controlled and maintained under similar conditions of temperature (20-23 • C) and humidity (50-60%).The study protocol adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee of the Ethical Committee of Clinical Research of Galicia (2019/204).\n\nParticipants underwent three separate sessions at day 0 (unfrozen formulation) and at days 30 and 120 post-freezing in which a baseline measurement of the TMH and subsequently of the NIKBUT was performed before the instillation of the formulation.Subsequently, 15 µL of the freshly made formulation (on day 0) or thawed formulation (on days 30 and 120) were instilled with a micropipette.TMH and NIKBUT were examined at 2, 5, 10, 15, and 30-min post-administration using Keratograph 5M ® .For TMH measurements, participants were asked to blink normally and then leave the eyes open to take the image of the inferior lacrimal meniscus.In the case of the NIKBUT analysis, participants were instructed to blink 2 times and try to keep their eyes open as long as possible.The light source chosen was visible and infrared for TMH and NIKBUT evaluation, respectively.TMH and NIKBUT measurements were carried out in triplicate.TMH was measured manually with a ruler integrated into the instrument software.Data were collected by a different investigator than the one who later analyzed them to avoid bias.\n\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nTo establish the expiry date of the compounded formulations the Pharmaceutical Codex was used, setting a reduction of ≥10% of cysteamine with respect to the initial concentration [35].The degradation rate (K), shelf-life (t 90 ) and determination coefficient (R 2 ) were calculated.Changes in pH and osmolality were considered unacceptable if their values exceeded the acceptance criteria for ophthalmic applications [36,37].Microbiological stability was considered acceptable when no microbial growth occurred in the cultured samples.\n\nThe results of the different assays were plotted using Graph Pad Prism ® v.9.0.1 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).The significance value was set at an α ≤ 0.05 for all statistical tests.Before analysis, the normal distribution of the data was checked using the two-way ANOVA test and the differences between results on devices were assessed using the ANOVA for paired measurements [38].Mean and standard deviation (SD) were used to describe the measurements in lacrimal parameters.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nPhysicochemical Stability\n\nThe amount of cysteamine remaining in the single-dose containers throughout the study is shown in Figure 1.The concentration of cysteamine in the formulation remained above the stability limit (>90%) until day 120 after freezing.Since at this point the concentration was very close to 90%, it was decided to terminate the stability study, since at later times the formulation would no longer be stable.The degradation rate (K) and shelf-life (t 90 ) were 0.07729%•day −1 and

throughout the study is depicted in Figure 2a.From these data it is possible to confirm that pH remains constant for 120 days after freezing, hovering around 6.6-6.8.During the study period, the osmolality of the formulations remained within ±5% of the initial value, approximately 350 mOsm/kg (Figure 2b).These results allow us to demonstrate that a longer period of storage does not affect these two physical parameters of the formulation.The viscosity results of the formulation at different times are shown in Figure 3.As was seen in the previous work, these values are around 30 mPa•s.As

after freezing the formulation for 30 and 120 days.Measurements were performed at baseline without instillation and after instillation for 30 min.Figure 5 shows changes in TMH before (a) and after the

at baseline without instillation and after instillation for 30 min.The mean TMH value for baseline measurements were 0.28 ± 0.066 mm, with a subsequent increase at 2 min after instillation with respect to basal to 0.474 ± 0.090, 0.449 ± 0.157, and 0.420 ± 0.121 for the unfrozen formulation, 30-day frozen formulation and 120-day frozen formulation, respectively.From that moment on, there was a decrease in the TMH, until reaching mean values similar to the baseline between minutes 10 and 15, relative to the elimination of the formulations due to physiological ocular eye wash (Figure 7a, and Table S2 of the supplementary material).This behavior was observed in a similar way in the three formulations.A comparison of these TMH values at different times (2, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min) was

± 0.066 mm, with a subsequent increase at 2 min after instillation with respect to basal to 0.474 ± 0.090, 0.449 ± 0.157, and 0.420 ± 0.121 for the unfrozen formulation, 30-day frozen formulation and 120-day frozen formulation, respectively.From that moment on, there was a decrease in the TMH, until reaching mean values similar to the baseline between minutes 10 and 15, relative to the elimination of the formulations due to physiological ocular eye wash (Figure 7a, and Table S2 of the supplementary material).This behavior was observed in a similar way in the three formulations.A comparison of these TMH values at different times (2, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min) was made between the unfrozen prepared formulation (day 0), and the 30-day and 120-day post-freezing formulation.Only differences between 30day frozen eye drops and 120-day frozen eye drops at min 30 were found, with a mean The mean TMH value for baseline measurements were 0.28 ± 0.066 mm, with a subsequent increase at 2 min after instillation with respect to basal to 0.474 ± 0.090, 0.449 ± 0.157, and 0.420 ± 0.121 for the unfrozen formulation, 30-day frozen formulation and 120-day frozen formulation, respectively.From that

eye wash (Figure 7a, and Table S2 of the supplementary material).This behavior was observed in a similar way in the three formulations.A comparison of these TMH values at different times (2, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min) was made between the unfrozen prepared formulation (day 0), and the 30-day and 120-day post-freezing formulation.Only differences between 30-day frozen eye drops and 120-day frozen eye drops at min 30 were found, with a mean TMH value of 0.2835 ± 0.059 mm for the formulation thawed at day 30, versus 0.2338 ± 0.043 mm for the formulation thawed at day 120 (Tukey, α = 0.0320).\n\nincrease at early test times compared to baseline values, relative to the residence of HA on the corneal surface after instillation, similar to what was previously observed for the TMH (10.89 ± 3.498 s at baseline versus 15.31 ± 6.292 s for unfrozen formulation; 11.69 ± 6.228 s at baseline versus 15.65 ± 5.083 s for 30-day frozen formulation; and 13.14 ± 5.690 s at baseline versus 14.36 ± 5.001 s for 120-day frozen formulation).This parameter was not altered in the comparison of formulation prior freezing and post-freezing formulations at all times (Tukey, all ≥ 0.9999, Figure 7b, Table S3 of the supplementary material).This was followed by a progressive decrease close to baseline levels related to the physiological processes of tear drainage and ocular eye wash.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nCystinosis is a rare genetic disease in which cystine crystals accumulate in the lysosomes of certain tissues such as kidneys, pancreas, and eyes [39].Although there are a couple of presentations marketed for the treatment of ocular cystinosis by the topical ophthalmic route (Cystagon ® and Cystadrops ® ), there are circumstances in which these treatments are not available.Therefore, HPDs continue to play a very important role in offering an alternative using pharmaceutical compounding [14].To ensure adequate galenic characteristics and to assign a period of validity it is necessary to carry out exhaustive characterization studies prior to translation into clinical practice.\n\nThe limited stability of cysteamine in solution has led to the search for different approaches to prevent its oxidation.One of the proposals is to lower storage temperature conditions [8,19].Permanent storage of cysteamine eye drops in the refrigerator is not feasible due to the frequency of instillation, which would require portability throughout the day by the patient under these conditions.Freezing is also not feasible when multidose containers are used since complete thawing of the entire solution would be necessary for each administration.To address these problems, we opted for packaging the developed cysteamine ophthalmic compounded formulation in single-dose containers [26].In the present work, the chemical stability of cysteamine in these containers stored for 120 days at −20 °C was studied, from which it was found that the concentration with respect to day 0 remains above 90% during all the study time.Regarding the NIKBUT analysis, the administration of all formulations showed an increase at early test times compared to baseline values, relative to the residence of HA on the corneal surface after instillation, similar to what was previously observed for the TMH (10.89 ± 3.498 s at baseline versus 15.31 ± 6.292 s for unfrozen formulation; 11.69 ± 6.228 s at baseline versus 15.65 ± 5.083 s for 30-day frozen formulation; and 13.14 ± 5.690 s at baseline versus 14.36 ± 5.001 s for 120-day frozen formulation).This parameter was

these containers stored for 120 days at −20 • C was studied, from which it was found that the concentration with respect to day 0 remains above 90% during all the study time.\n\nNumerous stability studies of cysteamine eye drops have been published, most of them carried out at room temperature and/or under refrigerated conditions [14,15,40,41].Reda et al. studied the stability of a 0.44% aqueous solution of cysteamine hydrochloride for a year at room temperature and in a freezer [16].This formulation contained only 61.6% cysteamine with respect to the initial when stored at room temperature for one week.In contrast, when storage was carried out under frozen conditions, cysteamine was maintained at 85.1% after 1 week, which would rule out its use (<90% of active ingredient) [35].However, after 52 weeks in the freezer, the concentration did not fall sharply, remaining at 85.7%.It is important to note that the composition of this formulation was substantially different from ours and the type of container is not specified, so these results cannot be directly compared.Another study about the effect of freezing on cysteamine stability was performed by Pescina et al., in which the effect of pH and the use of penetration enhancers on cysteamine stability were analyzed [42].They confirmed that the preparations with acid pH, disodium edetate (EDTA) and sodium phosphate were more stable, being those preserved at −20 • C the ones that preserved a higher percentage of cysteamine achieving a stability of up to 24 weeks.Moreover, Bozda g et al. achieved higher expiration periods (up to 52 weeks), using disodium EDTA and benzalkonium chloride in their composition, with a pH close to 4 [41].These low pH values are not particularly recommended for chronic use, as it is recommended that these values be as close as possible to the tear pH [43].\n\nOur formulation has a pH of around 6.8, closer to the physiological and, therefore, better tolerated, avoiding irritation and excessive tearing that compromises the permanence of the formulation.These constant values are related to the presence of the sodium citrate and citric acid monohydrate buffer present in the commercial vehicle, AQ [44].Stability of up to 12 weeks has been achieved by McKenzie et al. using sodium hyaluronate (SH) as a vehicle for cysteamine eye drops when packaged in closed ampoules protected from light at 4 • C. In addition to the differences related to the composition and the method of determination used, the type of packaging proposed would not be the most suitable for the administration of eye drops and their handling.Another alternative proposed to reduce the oxidation of cysteamine was the saturation with nitrogen, although this method has given rise to contradictory results and is not easy to use in the elaboration process [15,26,40].\n\nThe COL Eye Drops System used in this work is made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and di-n-octyl phthalate/di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DOP/DEHP) free [27], being one of the most widely used materials in the medical field due to its high stability.The effects that freeze-thawing processes may have on the material from which these vials are made are unknown.Therefore, it was previously demonstrated that their elastic properties were not affected, keeping Young's modulus values constant at different times after freezing [26].The determination of the oxygen permeability through the walls of the single-dose vials is of relevance given the high oxidizability of cysteamine.Transmission of small molecules of gas, like dry oxygen, through a polymeric material can take place through two processes.First of all, due to the pore effect, in which the gas molecules flow through microscopic pores, pinholes and cracks in the materials.In this case, as demonstrated/mentioned before, the mechanical properties of the material remain stable during the freezing process avoiding the formation of cracks, holes, or tortuous pathways through which the oxygen gas can pass through the polymeric material.Secondly, due to a solubility-diffusion effect, in which the gas molecules dissolved at one of the polymer surfaces diffuse through the polymer to the opposite surface driven by a concentration gradient between the two polymer surfaces.In this case, the concentration difference between the two sides of the polymeric material and the solubility of gases in the corresponding material determines the level of transmission.Both factors, the freezing of the package and the exposure of the polymer to the cysteamine solution over time, prevent the changing the gas solubility in the polymer, consequently, the oxygen transmission values not only did not increase the permeability of the single-use vial to oxygen, but slightly decreased it.The exposure of the polymer to the cysteamine solution also has no effect on the structure of the material under test conditions.It is also important to bear in mind that oxygen diffuses worse in the frozen product than in a liquid solution, so that, in addition to the reduction in permeability of the container itself, the amount of oxygen diffusing into the sample can be expected to be lower.\n\nNumerous studies have described how an increase in residence time decreases the rate of drug elimination favoring the bioavailability and efficacy of the formulation [45,46].Residence time on the ocular surface is related to viscosity [47].The association between efficacy and the percentage of HA present in artificial tear has been studied in preclinical and clinical studies, concluding that formulations with higher percentages of HA and higher viscosities improved the signs and symptoms of the dry eye disease because the ocular residence time was increased [45,48,49].The optimum viscosity of an eye drop was established between 15 to 50 mPa•s [50].Even though there is such a wide range of viscosities allowed, the optimum value must be the one that does not cause discomfort or blurred vision.In this sense, Ntonti et al. concluded that 24.2 mPa•s could be the most optimal value when the vehicle is HA [51].Biswas et al. described how more aqueous formulations of cysteamine must have more continuous dosages because of their low bioavailability due to the physiological processes of drainage and eye wash [52].Liang et al. described that the use of a formulation with a vehicle with better rheological properties improves the bioavailability of the drug, decreasing the dosage [53].In our formulation, viscosity suffered a significant drop in those vials kept in the freezer, results in line with the previous work [26].The relevance of this behavior was contrasted with preclinical PET studies in which the residence time on the ocular surface was measured [26], leading to the conclusion that the reduction in viscosity did not translate into a shorter ocular biopermanence time.\n\nIn order to confirm these data in humans, an indirect measurement of residence on the ocular surface was performed by measuring TMH and NIKBUT after the instillation of the unfrozen eye drops and after 30 and 120 days of freezing.These techniques provide indirect insight into how viscosity affects the residence time of the vehicle on the ocular surface from tear stabilization data [47, 54,55].In our study, it has been shown that even with differences in viscosity, no changes were found in the THM and NIKBUT values in none of the study days compared to the unfrozen formulation.Therefore, we can conclude that freezing for 120 days does not modify the ocular residence time and the bioavailability of the formulation studied.On the other hand, these techniques do not allow a direct comparison of the data with those previously obtained in rats by PET studies, since it is not possible to fit the data to a mono-exponential equation and obtain a half-life on the ocular surface.Regarding the limitations of the study, it is important to note that the TMH and NIKBUT data are related to tear stability and volume, having been used indirectly in the present study as a way of characterizing the permanence of the vehicle on the ocular surface and, therefore, of the formulation.In addition, although environmental conditions were controlled and maintained, it would be ideal to carry out the study in a chamber that maintains constant temperature and humidity conditions for all individuals and days of the study.On the other hand, the effect of diurnal tear variations has been reduced as much as possible by conducting the bioavailability study between 9 a.m. and 12 a.m., which is one of the greatest strengths of this work based on previous publications [32][33][34].Another limitation of the present study is that the clinical study was carried out in healthy volunteers, although it would be ideal to perform it in patients diagnosed with cystinosis.Longer retention times would favor the pharmacological action of cysteamine in patients who, if left untreated, are expected to suffer disease progression with crystal formation, leading to photophobia, visual impairment and eventually blindness.\n\nTo the authors' knowledge, our study is the first to utilize the Keratograph 5M to assess the ocular residence time of cysteamine eye drops.Even so, these techniques have been used previously with the aim of characterizing the tear of patients with cystinosis treated with the commercial presentation.Tear film osmolarity and tear breakup time have been evaluated to understand the pathophysiology of adverse reactions reported by cystinosis patients treated with topical viscous cysteamine hydrochloride (Cystadrops ® ).In this respect, Sergio et al. analyzed the tear film breakup time (TBUT) using a slit lamp with a cobalt blue filter and a fluorescein strip.The mean TBUT value was 10.2 ± 0.83 s in the treatment group versus 10 ± 0.7 s in the control group (p = 0.62) [56].\n\nFinally, it is important to mention that other techniques as optical coherence tomography (OCT), have been used to evaluate the ocular residence of SH.The dynamics of the tear meniscus after the instillation of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3% SH showed that all formulations provided higher TMH, being the time with the highest TMH values at 10 min for 0.3% SH, coinciding with the highest viscosity value.They concluded that TMH increased directly with the viscosity and SH concentration, resulting in longer residence times and higher bioavailability [57].Akiyama-Fukuda et al. evaluated with OCT how the instillation of different HA concentrations affected tear meniscus dynamics by measuring volume, area and height at different times after administration [58].Tear meniscus measurements were found to be higher with the highest HA concentration, having a bioavailability of up to 15 min.Another study in an animal model of dry eye disease found that animals treated with HA eye drops had higher TBUT values than those treated with BSS ® .They related the rheological properties of the eye drops with an improvement in tear stability and longer residence times [48].\n\n\nConclusions\n\nCysteamine hydrochloride eye drops 0.55% in HA packaged in single-dose containers can be stored for 4 months at −20 • C. To ensure its concentration during use, it is recommended to use it at room temperature for the first 16 h after opening.Ocular surface permanence studies in healthy volunteers allow us to conclude storage in freezing for long periods of time does not affect the bioavailability of the formulation or the physical characteristics of the container.These results will reduce the number of visits to the hospital by patients, improving patients' quality of life, and lightening the workload of the HPD.\n\nFigure 1 .\n1\nFigure 1.Cysteamine content (%) with respect to day 0 of the cysteamine compounded formulation stored at −20 °C for 120 days protected from light at day 0 (unfrozen formulation) and days 30, 60, 90 and 120 post-freezing.\n\n\nFigure 2 .\n2\nFigure 2.

Orthopaedic Association, 15546\nBACKGROUNDPlantar fasciitis (PF) affects around 10% of the population.Prefabricated orthotics with arch support has been shown to provide symptom relief in PF by decreasing the repetitive stress sustained by the plantar fascia.However, prefabricated orthotics are only effective when shoes are worn, meaning the foot may be left unsupported when it is impractical to wear shoes.Using orthotic sandals in conjunction with prefabricated orthotics may increase PF symptom relief, as they can be worn inside the home, extending the period in which the foot is supported.AIMTo compare the combined use of prefabricated orthotics and orthotic sandals vs the sole use of prefabricated orthotics in the treatment of PF.METHODS 98 participants with PF were randomised into two groups.The intervention group received the Aetrex L420 Compete orthotics and the Aetrex L3000 Maui Flips (orthotic sandals), whilst the control group received the Aetrex L420 Compete orthotics only.Foot pain was assessed both by the numerical rating scale (NRS) and the pain sub-scale of the foot health status questionnaire (FHSQ).Foot functionality was measured using the function sub-scale of the FHSQ.Symptom change was measured using the global rating of change scale (GROC).RESULTS\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nPlantar fasciitis (PF) is the most common cause of heel pain, affecting 10% of the population [1].Despite the name \"fasciitis\", which suggests inflammatory causes, the condition is indicated to result from degeneration of the plantar fascia.Histological findings typically reveal degenerative changes such as localised fibrosis, matrix calcification, collagen necrosis and angiofibroblastic hyperplasia.Hence, the term plantar fasciopathy may be preferred [2].PF is most commonly found in individuals between 40 and 70 years old and is more frequent in women than in men [1,3].Both physically active and sedentary populations can develop the condition, and risk factors consist of, among others, a recent increase in running, prolonged standing activities, tightness of the gastrocnemius, obesity, pes cavus or pes planus foot types, and the use of footwear that is either unsupportive or that alters foot kinematics [1].Although the exact aetiology of the condition remains unclear, mechanical overload is thought to contribute to its development [4].Studies have shown that excessive tensile forces on the fascia cause microscopic changes [5].Disparity in leg length and tightness of the gastrocnemius contribute to increased tensile loading of the fascia, which heightens the pressure on the longitudinal arch [6].This may result in microscopic tears and degeneration in the fascia.Symptoms include sharp pain following palpation of the medial plantar calcaneal region and heel pain during the first steps of the day or following extended periods of inactivity [4].The resulting pain from PF can cause activity limitation and considerable disability, negatively impacting overall quality of life [7].\n\nPF is a self-limiting condition, with most cases resolving within 6 to 18 mo [8].However, some reports suggest that up to 49% of PF patients are symptomatic for 1.5 to 5 years following the onset of symptoms, and an estimated 2 million people worldwide will receive treatment for the condition annually [9,10].However, there is currently no standardised treatment method for the condition, with very few studies providing high-quality analysis across different treatment modalities [11].Furthermore, many studies use treatment methods in combination, making it difficult to determine which is the most beneficial as a stand-alone modality.\n\nGastrocnemius contracture is an evident contributor to PF [12], and so stretching techniques such as calf-stretching and plantar-fascia-specific-stretching are frequently prescribed.However, a systematic review of the literature found only very low-quality evidence to support their use over sham stretching [13].Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently used in the treatment of PF.Long-term use of NSAIDs, defined as consumption of three or more times a week for more than three months [14], is not without risk of complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, nephrotoxicity, and dependency [15].A 2015 systematic review evaluated the literature investigating the efficacy of various taping techniques, including calcaneal and low dye taping, in the treatment of PF.The review found that taping, in general, is beneficial in treating the condition.However, all studies included in the review only assessed short-term effects, so no evidence was available regarding long-term outcomes [16].Probe et al [17] assessed the effects of the combined use of Achilles stretching exercises, shoe recommendations and anti-inflammatory medications, with and without the addition of night splints, on PF symptoms.They found that the addition of night splints provided no statistical difference in improvements.\n\nOrthotics have been found to decrease foot pain and increase function in PF patients compared to other non-interventional methods [18].Such benefits from orthotics result from evened weight distribution across the plantar area and arch, shock absorption, and enhanced proprioception [19,20].The arches of the foot are maintained not just by bony contours but also by the soft tissues that surround the structure.During weight bearing, the arches are depressed and lengthened.The repetitive lengthening whilst weight bearing has been implicated as one of the causative mechanisms of PF [21].A contoured orthotic which provides mechanical support to the foot prevents repetitive deformation whilst weight bearing and thereby can provide symptom relief and prevent relapse of PF [21].However, a recent systematic review and metaanalyses of orthotics for plantar heel pain have reported low-quality evidence due to the high risk of bias in studies [22].Another systematic review and meta-analyses suggest that conclusions have been drawn from low-quality trials and future high-quality trials are required [23].\n\nLike orthotic insoles, orthotic sandals may offer improved arch support and even weight distribution.Research has shown that the use of orthotic sandals and flip-flops with moulded footbeds can have significant effects on the symptoms of PF, including foot pain, function, and foot health [24,25].The combined use of orthotics and orthotic sandals may be appropriate, as they are both non-invasive and complement each other.Although PF is self-limiting, it is painful and disabling during periods of activity, and hence symptom relief is essential.Unfortunately, orthotics can only be used when donning shoes.Utilising orthotic sandals in conjunction with prefabricated orthotics may enhance symptom relief in PF, as orthotic sandals can be used when donning shoes may not be practical, as whilst at home and indoors.The pain and symptoms from PF is also most severe early in the morning on waking.It may be more feasible to get into orthotic sandals rather than into shoes and orthotics as one takes the first step in the morning.To our knowledge, no research has been conducted into the effects of the combined use of prefabricated orthotics and orthotic sandals in the treatment of PF.\n\nHence the aim of this study is to identify if the combined use of prefabricated orthotics and orthotic sandals is superior to the use of orthotics only in the treatment of PF.The clinical significance for health providers and patients is that though PF is a self-limiting disorder, symptom relief is required during the active phase of the disease.As most cases of PF only require symptomatic treatment, it is needless to burden the overstretched healthcare system to treat this disorder.This trial hopes to identify a method by which patients can safely and reliably choose a non-invasive treatment modality to address plantar heel pain.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nThis study is a non-blinded randomised control trial (RCT) and was conducted over a period of 17 mo between July 2021 and November 2022 through an independent musculoskeletal clinic.The participants were volunteers who responded to social media advertisements about the study.The primary objective is to investigate whether the combined use of prefabricated orthotics and orthotic sandals vs the sole use of prefabricated orthotics is more beneficial in decreasing foot pain and increasing foot functionality in PF.The Wales Research Ethics Committee (REC) 5 provided ethical approval on April 14, 2021 by REC reference: 21/WA/0099 and IRAS project ID: 297181.Reporting of the study conforms to the CONSORT statement (CONSORT 2010 statement) [26].\n\n\nSample size calculation\n\nA sample size calculation was performed using a target of a one-point change in the numerical rating scale (NRS) pain score (SD 1.6) (the primary outcome), with 80% power and a significance level of 5%.A 20% drop-out rate was allowed.This led to a required sample size of 52 per group, resulting in a total sample size of 104 study participants.\n\n\nParticipants\n\nParticipants were recruited from mainland United Kingdom including England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on a voluntary basis through social media advertisements.Potential participants were provided with a participant information sheet by post or email.\n\nPF whose ICD-10-CM diagnosis code is M72.2[27], is diagnosed both from history and examination findings.The study was designed during the coronavirus pandemic when non-urgent and non-acute cases were diverted to telephone or online consultations.In telephone and online consultations, a physical clinical examination is not possible.To accommodate the restrictions of the lockdown and social distancing the study was designed to diagnose PF only from history and without the advantage of physical examination.To be included in the study, participants had to state that their pain was in the medial-inner aspect of the heel and that the pain was most severe in the morning upon waking.If a potential participant stated otherwise, they were disqualified from participating in the trial.Participants then had a telephone consultation with the lead investigator, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon who has 20 + years of experience post certificate of completion of speciality training.\n\nInclusion criteria required participants to be aged between 18-75 years old and to have experienced symptoms of PF for at least two months.Participants were excluded if they had received any treatment other than analgesia within the last 12 mo, had any history of foot surgery, and had any congenital or acquired foot abnormalities that would prevent the use of normal footwear.Participants were informed that they could withdraw from the study at any time without needing to give a reason.Participants were then given the opportunity to raise any questions they had about the study.Subse-quently, participants agreeing to enrol in the trial were asked to provide informed written consent, either online via legalesign.com,or by post.\n\n\nRandomisation\n\nFollowing recruitment, participants were randomised into one of two groups using an allocation ratio of 1: 1, the intervention group, or the control group.Randomisation was achieved by opening sealed, opaque envelopes, which either contained labels stating, \"O and F\", denoting orthotics and flips (sandals) and corresponding to the intervention group or \"O Only\", denoting orthotics only and corresponding to the control group.An individual independent of the research team then randomly selected an envelope, the contents of which assigned the participant to their group.Blinding of participants or researchers was not possible due to the nature of the study.\n\n\nIntervention\n\nParticipants in the intervention group received both the Aetrex L420 Compete orthotics (Figure 1) and the Aetrex L3000 Maui Flips (Figure 2) by post according to their shoe size.Participants in the control group received the Aetrex L420 Compete orthotics only.Participants were instructed to use the devices where possible for a period of 6 mo.\n\n\nData collection\n\nBasic demographic information and baseline data were collected upon recruitment.The outcome measures used in this study were foot pain by NRS and foot health status questionnaire (FHSQ), foot functionality (by FHSQ) and change in PF symptoms [by global rating of change scale (GROC)].Data for all outcomes were collected via questionnaires upon initial recruitment, then at three weeks, six weeks, three months, and six months.Participants completed this questionnaire online at smartsurvey.co.uk or as a paper copy provided via post, depending on their preference.\n\n\nPrimary outcome measure\n\nThe primary outcome measure was to measure the change of foot pain between baseline and 6 mo follow-up using an 11point NRS, which ranged from zero, denoting \"no pain\", and ten, denoting \"extremely severe pain\".The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) on the NRS scale is a 1.7 score change of the median [28].\n\n\nSecondary outcome measures\n\nFoot pain was also scored along with foot functionality using the \"foot pain\" and \"foot functionality\" sub-scales of the FHSQ.For these sub-scales, 5-point likert scales ranging from \"no problems, pain or limitations\" to \"severe problems, pain or limitations\" were provided.A dedicated FHSQ programme (https://www.fhsq.org/)was then utilised to calculate an overall score between 0 and 100, depending on the participants' answers, with 0 representing \"the worst foot health\" and 100 representing \"the best foot health\".The MCID for the FHSQ pain subscale is 13 points and for the FHSQ function subscale is 7 points [29].Change in symptoms was assessed using the GROC, an 11-point scale from -5 to + 5, with \"-5\" representing \"very much worse\", \"0\" representing \"no change\" and \"+5\" representing \"completely recovered\".\n\nA data monitoring committee consisting of patients, an independent doctor not part of the research team, and a medical statistician was implemented during the study to ensure that the data collected was legitimate and reliable and to observe for any significant adverse outcomes.\n\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nNRS for pain: Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to assess the within-group statistical significance of changes from baseline to 6-mo follow-up of the NRS pain scale.The Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess the between-group statistical differences for the two groups from baseline to six months.\n\n\nFHSQ pain and function sub-scales:\n\nThe paired T-test was used to assess the within-group statistical significance of changes from baseline to 6-mo follow-up of the FHSQ pain and function sub-scale.The independent sample t-test was used to compare the between-group differences.\n\nGROC: Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to assess the within-group statistical significance of changes from 3 wk to 6mo follow-up on the GROC scale.The Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess the between-group statistical differences for the two groups from 3 wk to six months.The statistical methods of this study were reviewed by an independent statistician from the department of data health sciences, University of Liverpool.\n\n\nRESULTS\n\nOne hundred and four participants were recruited for this RCT.Of these 104 participants, six were not included in the final analysis (drop-out rate = 5.7%), leaving a total of 98 participants to be included in the analysis.In the intervention group (orthotics and orthotic sandals) 1 participant failed to respond and 1 discontinued as the orthotic was uncomfortable.In the control group 2 participants failed to respond, 1 passed away due to unrelated reasons and 1 discontinued as the orthotic did not fit in the shoe.Ninety-eight of the 104 complied with the treatment giving a compliance rate of 94.2%.Details of participant flow through the study, including the number of withdrawals and reasons, are provided in Figure 3. Fifty of the 98 participants included in the analysis were randomly allocated to the intervention group and 48 to the control group.Data collection began in July 2021 and ended in November 2022.The baseline demographics of the participants in the intervention and control groups are shown in Table 1.The participants' ages ranged from 29 to 71 years old (mean age = 48.81).Participants in the intervention group with the combined use of orthotics and the orthotic sandals were, on average, slightly younger (mean age = 48.44)than participants in the control group with the sole use of orthotics (mean age = 49.19).Participants in both the intervention group (94%) and the control group (91.6%) were predominantly female.Results for all outcome measures are provided in Table 2.All outcomes were collected at baseline, 3 wk, 6 wk, 3 mo and 6 mo, aside from the GROC, which was collected at all time points except baseline.\n\nAt 6 mo, there was a statistically significant improvement in foot pain by the NRS in both groups.Median change of pain was 6 [interquartile range (IQR) 3.25, P < 0.001] in the interventional group with the combined use of orthotics and orthotic sandals and 4 (IQR 4.75, P < 0.001) in the control group with the sole use of orthotics.Between-group analysis with the Mann-Whitney U test showed statistically significant improvement (P = 0.003) in the interventional group with the combined use of orthotics and orthotic sandals as compared to the sole use of orthotics.\n\nMean pain scores on the FSHQ subscale improved significantly during the six-month period in the interventional group by 51.49 points [95% confidence interval (CI): 44.52 to 58.46, P < 0.001] and in the control group by 42.07 points (95% CI: 35.20 to 48.94, P < 0.001).Between-group analysis showed that though the mean pain score improved more in the intervention group with the combined use of orthotics and orthotic sandals as compared to the control group with the sole use of orthotics, it did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.07).\n\nFoot functionality, measured using the function sub-scale of the FHSQ, improved during the six-month period in the interventional group by 41.50 (95% CI: 34.44 to 48.56, P < 0.001) and in the control group by 37.64 (95% CI: 30.19 to 45.09, P = 0.001).Between-group analysis showed that there was again greater improvement of function in the intervention group with the combined use of orthotics and orthotic sandals as compared to the control group with the sole use of orthotics, the improvement was not significant (P = 0.46).\n\nThe findings for the GROC scale demonstrated statistically significant improvement in symptoms over time for both groups (Median improvement in intervention group 2 (P < 0.05) vs Median improvement in control group 2 (P < 0.05).Between-group analysis showed that there was again greater improvement of symptoms in the intervention group with the combined use of orthotics and orthotic sandals as compared to the control group with the sole use of orthotics, but the improvement was not significant (P = 0.093).\n\nFigures 4-7 show how the study outcomes varied for each group over time.Figures 4,5 and 6 show that, for both the intervention group with the combined use of the orthotics and orthotic sandals and the control group with the sole use of orthotics, the greatest improvements in foot pain reported via NRS and FHSQ pain sub-scale and foot functionality reported via the FHSQ function sub-scale, were between baseline and 3 wk.Following the 3-wk period, there was a slower but sustained improvement in both groups.Additionally, for these three outcomes, the rate of initial improvement between baseline and week 3 was greater for the intervention group with the combined use of the orthotics and orthotic sandals than the control group with the sole use of orthotics.Figure 7 shows the median change in GROC scale scores for each group over time.At each time point that data were collected, a greater improvement in symptoms was reported by the intervention group with the combined use of the orthotics and orthotic sandals than by the control group with the sole use of orthotics.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThis article presents the results from a RCT.The study investigated whether the combined use of prefabricated orthotics and orthotic sandals provided enhanced symptom relief from PF in comparison to the sole use of orthotics.\n\nThe main findings show that both the intervention group with the combined use of orthotics and orthotic sandals and the control group with the sole use of orthotics experienced significant decreases in foot pain at 6 mo as assessed via both the NRS and FHSQ pain sub-scale.Decreases in foot pain on both measures were significantly greater in the intervention group with the combined use of orthotics and orthotic sandals, as compared to the control group with the sole use of orthotics.However, between-group differences in pain scores reached statistical significance only on the NRS pain score ( P < 0.05).Foot function, as assessed by the FHSQ function sub-scale, also showed statistically significant improvement in both the intervention and control groups at 6 mo.Similarly, there was greater improvement in foot function in the intervention group with the combined use of orthotics and orthotic sandals compared to the control group with the sole use of orthotics but it did not reach statistical significance.At 6 mo, the GROC showed a statistically significant improvement in each of the two groups but between-group analysis did not reach statistical significance.\n\nBaldassin et al [30] evaluated the effectiveness of both prefabricated and customised insoles on PF in 142 symptomatic adults.The study employed the visual analogue score (VAS) and the foot function index (FFI) to compare pain and function at baseline, 4 wk, and 8 wk.Results showed that both the use of prefabricated and customised orthotics significantly reduced pain and improved function at 8 wk.However, no significant difference was found between the two groups, suggesting that the costlier customised orthotics were not superior to prefabricated orthotics.\n\nConversely, other studies have had mixed results.Landorf et al [7] conducted an RCT containing 136 participants who were randomised into one of three groups to receive either prefabricated foot orthotics, custom foot orthotics or sham orthotics (placebo).Like the current study, this employed the FHSQ to evaluate pain and function.Findings revealed that, at 3 mo, both prefabricated and custom orthotics significantly improved function.However, no continued significant effects were observable at 12 mo for any outcome in either group.This lack of continued significant improvement at 12 mo may have been caused by the self-limiting nature of PF, in which spontaneous resolution of symptoms may occur with the passage of time.Nevertheless, the findings did show that prefabricated orthotics are effective in the period when the symptoms of PF are potentially most severe.Furthermore, results indicate that more cost-effective prefabricated orthotics obtain similar results to the costlier custom orthotics.Wrobel et al [18] conducted a RCT to compare the use of custom foot orthoses (CFO), prefabricated foot orthoses (PFO) and sham insoles for the treatment of PF.Outcomes measured were first-step pain, end-of-day pain, Revised FFI short form (FFI-R), and a short form health survey.Following 3 mo of orthoses/sham insole use, the results showed that both the CFO and PFO groups demonstrated significant improvements in morning and evening pain.All groups, including the sham orthotics group, also reported significant improvements in FFI-R pain and short form health survey at 3 mo.\n\nCosta et al [31] evaluated the efficacy of flip-flop sandals, adapted with insoles, on pain and function in PF patients.Sixty-six participants were randomised to receive either a pair of adapted flip-flop sandals with custom insoles or a pair of un-adapted plain sandals.Participants were instructed to use the flip-flops for at least 4 h a day for 12 wk.Data regarding first-step pain, as assessed by VAS, and function, as assessed by the FFI, were collected at baseline and 12 wk.Results showed that the group with the adapted flip-flop sandals with custom insoles had significant improvements with first-step pain and function compared to the un-adapted plain sandals group.\n\nIn addition, Chuter et al [25] investigated the effects of sandals with a moulded footbed on pain and function in PF.Results showed that, after 12 wk of intervention, there were significant improvements in the primary outcome of foot pain, also measured using FHSQ.In further agreement with our study findings, secondary outcomes of function and pain measured using VAS also improved significantly.\n\nVicenzino et al [24] compared the effects of a contoured sandal, a flat flip-flop and contoured in-shoe orthotics for plantar heel pain.The study contained 50 participants who had experienced plantar heel pain for at least 4 wk.Like our study, this used a GROC scale to determine change in symptoms.The lower extremity function scale (LEFS) was also used to assess function.Findings showed that participants who had been provided with the contoured sandals were 68% more likely to experience symptom improvement using the GROC compared to those who used the flat flip-flop.The contoured sandal group was also 61% more likely to report improvements on the LEFS.No significant differences were observed between the effects of the contoured sandals and the contoured in-shoe orthotics.The findings of these investigations, along with the findings of our study, suggest that the use of orthotic sandals is effective in the treatment of PF.\n\nIn our study, the intervention group with the combined use of orthotics and orthotic sandals reported greater improvements on all measures than the control group with the sole use of orthotics.However statistical significance in between-group differences was only reached on the NRS pain scale.We hypothesise that these enhanced benefits were due to the extended periods of support to the feet, and consequent symptomatic relief, provided by the orthotic sandals.Prior to this study, the combined use of prefabricated orthotics and prefabricated orthotic sandals for PF had not been investigated.Nevertheless, studies have assessed the effects of sandals whose weight-bearing surface is contoured like an orthotic on PF as an independent intervention.\n\nThe current study investigated the long-term benefits of the intervention, with final data collection at 6 mo.In comparison, other studies only investigated short-term symptom relief, such as 8 wk[25], and 12 wk[26].The natural history of PF is that most cases resolve spontaneously within 6 to 18 mo [8], and hence symptom relief is required during the active or symptomatic phase of the study.This study demonstrates that both the combined use of orthotics and orthotic sandals or the sole use of orthotics alone can be beneficial for relieving symptoms of PF when it is most symptomatic.In addition, both orthotics and orthotic sandals are drug-free and non-invasive modality to treat PF.Hence it has a lower cost burden and decreased long-term risk profile than other treatment strategies.The combined use of orthotics and orthotic sandals were better on all outcome measures as compared to the sole use of orthotics but between group differences only reached statistical significance on the NRS pains scales.The findings of this study contribute to existing literature surrounding the use of orthotics and orthotic sandals in the treatment of PF.By combining the use of prefabricated orthotics and prefabricated orthotic sandals, this study has taken a novel approach.To our knowledge, no study has previously been conducted into the combined effects of prefabricated orthotics and orthotic sandals.We wish to propose that the combined use of orthotics and orthotics sandals resulted in greater improvement due to the increased time that the foot is supported.\n\n\nStrengths and limitations\n\nA strength of this study is the inclusion of participants with a wide age range of 18-75 years old.This increases the generalisability of our findings to the wider population of patients with PF.The cohort recruited for this trial is similar to other studies in terms of mean age and female predominance[30,31], and reflects global prevalence [3,32].\n\nHowever, as participants were recruited voluntarily through social media adverts, the sample may not be representative of the general population.This might have limited our participants to individuals who use the computer, internet and social media whilst excluding a large segment of the population that do not use digital media.\n\nIn addition, the study design was drafted in the periods of national lockdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic.It was not known for how long the national lockdowns would last and therefore the protocol and the study design were created to accommodate social distancing by introducing telephone/virtual consultation with the lead author on inclusion into the study.The telephone/virtual consultation and the lack of a physical examination could have led to both over and under-diagnosis of PF in the study population.\n\nIn this study, both groups showed significant improvements in foot pain, foot function and symptoms.Significant improvements in control groups may be associated with factors such as regression to the mean and Hawthorne effects [31].Due to the nature of this study, blinding participants to group allocation was not possible.Therefore, participants in    the intervention group may have expectations that the combined use of orthotics and orthotic sandals would improve pain and functionality.In future studies, the use of a sham orthotic placebo may be beneficial in reducing bias.However, a sham intervention should provide as little an effect as possible whilst being perceived as equally credible compared to the real intervention [33].Hence, a sham orthotic should not provide the same mechanical benefits as the real orthotics, and yet participants should expect both to provide similar effects.This may be difficult when attempting to blind participants, as they may detect the sham as a fake, causing their results to be influenced by the nocebo effect.Mitigating this would depend greatly on the design of the sham orthotic to convince the participants that the sham they receive is credible.However, inconsistencies have been found in the construction, blinding and biomechanical validation of sham orthotics in research.Therefore, the quality and reliability of the findings from studies which utilised sham orthotics have been questioned [34].NRS was selected as the outcome measure to score pain, and though this has been shown to be valid, reliable and appropriate when used for the assessment of pain [35], it is still subjective and therefore has the potential for bias.\n\nIn future studies, it would be valuable to collect data on how long each participant has been experiencing plantar heel pain before the study commenced.PF is a self-limiting condition that spontaneously resolves within 12 mo in 75% of cases [36].Therefore, a natural improvement would be expected regardless of intervention.Hence, data on the duration of participants' pre-study PF would have allowed for this to be factored into the analysis.In addition, monitoring of how often each participant wore orthotic devices would be advised in future studies to determine study compliance and reveal the effect on outcomes.This study was not designed to collect information on risk factors for PF, such as structural foot abnormalities, activity levels, high body mass index etc.Future studies may find a correlation between the prevalence of these risk factors and their influence on PF symptom control when using orthotics and orthotic sandals.The current study also did not collect data on concurrent or past treatments like physiotherapy and exercises.This could also be considered in future studies.\n\nHowever, the main purpose of the study was to empower patients to choose a non-invasive and over-the-counter treatment to address PF or plantar heel pain without the need to seek professional help and thereby reduce the burden on the health care system.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe within-group results of this study indicate that both the combined use of prefabricated orthotics and orthotic sandals, as well as the sole use of prefabricated orthotics, significantly improved pain and function in PF in all the four outcome measures utilised in this study.Between-group analysis showed that the combined use of orthotics and orthotic sandals provided better benefits than the sole use of orthotics in all four outcome measures, but the improvement was statistically significant only for foot pain on the NRS scale.\n\n\nARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS\n\n\nResearch background\n\nPrefabricated orthotics with arch support provides symptom relief in plantar fasciitis (PF) but are only effective when shoes are worn.Hence, the foot may be left unsupported when it is impractical to wear shoes, such as in the morning or evening at home.Utilising orthotic sandals in conjunction with prefabricated orthotics may enhance symptom relief for PF patients, as they can be worn inside the home, thereby extending the period in which the foot is supported.Prefabricated orthotics and orthotic sandals have been investigated as treatment methods for PF independently, but not in\n\nFigure\n\nFigure Aetrex L420 Compete orthotics.This orthotic was provided to participants in both the

Accepted: 13 October 2023transcatheter aortic valve implantationrenal insufficiencyMR angiographyCT angiography\nBackground: We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a non-contrast time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF-MRA) protocol for the pre-procedural access route assessment of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in comparison with contrast-enhanced cardiac dual-source computed tomography angiography (CTA).Methods and Results: In total, 51 consecutive patients (mean age: 82.69 ± 5.69 years) who had undergone a pre-TAVI cardiac CTA received TOF-MRA for a pre-procedural access route assessment.The MRA image quality was rated as very good (median of 5 [IQR 4-5] on a five-point Likert scale), with only four examinations rated as non-diagnostic.The TOF-MRA systematically underestimated the minimal effective vessel diameter in comparison with CTA (for the effective vessel diameter in mm, the right common iliac artery (CIA)/external iliac artery (EIA)/common femoral artery (CFA) MRA vs. CTA was 8.04 ± 1.46 vs. 8.37 ± 1.54 (p < 0.0001) and the left CIA/EIA/CFA MRA vs. CTA was 8.07 ± 1.32 vs. 8.28 ± 1.34 (p < 0.0001)).The absolute difference between the MRA and CTA was small (for the Bland-Altman analyses in mm, the right CIA/EIA/CFA was −0.36 ± 0.77 and the left CIA/EIA/CFA was −0.25 ± 0.61).The overall correlation between the MRA and CTA measurements was very good (with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.87 (p < 0.0001) for the right CIA/EIA/CFA and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9 (p < 0.0001) for the left CIA/EIA/CFA).The feasibility agreement between the MRA and CTA for transfemoral access was good (the right CIA/EIA/CFA agreement was 97.9% and the left CIA/EIA/CFA agreement was 95.7%, Kohen's kappa: 0.477 (p = 0.001)).Conclusions: The TOF-MRA protocol was feasible for the assessment of the access route in an all-comer pre-TAVI population.This protocol might be a reliable technique for patients at an increased risk of contrast-induced nephropathy.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAt present, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is the standard of care for patients with severe aortic stenosis and increased perioperative risks [1][2][3].Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is the gold standard imaging tool used to plan the procedure [4,5].This diagnostic tool permits an excellent three-dimensional assessment of the aortic annulus and the access route.CTA also facilitates the identification of predictors for increased periprocedural risks.These include the extent of the left-ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) calcification and coronary ostial height as predictors of annular ruptures or coronary occlusions, respectively, or the presence and extent of aortic arch atheroma and the extent of aortic valve calcification as predictors of postprocedural strokes [6].CTA-based TAVI planning requires the use of intravenous iodinated contrast media.The high prevalence of impaired renal functions at the baseline in a cohort of elderly, multimorbid patients had an increased risk of contrast-induced nephropathy [7].Contrast-induced nephropathy appears to have a negative influence on the procedural outcome [8].Recently, published data from a large registry of over 100,000 patients revealed that more than ten percent had experienced a postprocedural acute kidney injury following transcatheter aortic valve implantation.A kidney injury stage 3 or higher is associated with a seven-fold increase in one-year mortality [9].\n\nIn a previous study, we described the feasibility and accuracy of respiratory and ECG-triggered 3D non-contrast MRA for aortic annulus assessments in comparison with contrast-enhanced CTA [10].To date, there are sparse data on non-contrast assessments of the aortofemoral access route.\n\nThus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of a noncontrast time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF-MRA) protocol for preprocedural femoral access route assessments of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVR) in comparison with contrast-enhanced cardiac dual-source computed tomography angiography (CTA).\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nStudy Population\n\nThe potential candidates for inclusion in this study were all patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who had been referred for CTA prior to a TAVI evaluation between February 2014 and March 2017.Patients were prospectively enrolled if none of the exclusion criteria were present.The exclusion criteria were a rejection of the MRA examination, the inability to remain in a supine position due to severe orthopnea or a reduced general state of health, the presence of metallic foreign bodies, a permanent pacemaker or severe claustrophobia.This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n\nCTA Data Acquisition\n\nCTA examinations were performed using a second-generation dual-source CT scanner (Somatom Definition Flash, Siemens healthineers, Erlangen, Germany).\n\nIn total, 50 mL of a commercially available contrast medium (Imeron 400 ® , Bracco, Konstanz, Germany) was used as an iodinated contrast agent with a dual-phasic injection protocol (divided into an initial bolus of 40 mL at 4 mL/s followed by 20 mL of a 50%:50% mixture with NaCl at 4 mL/s), with bolus-triggering in the ascending aorta.For this purpose, a region of interest (ROI) was placed in the left atrium.Data acquisition began 7 seconds after the attenuation of the ROI reached 70 Hounsfield units (HUs) (a bolus tracking technique), with the retrospective ECG-gated data acquisition of the aortic root followed by a non-gated aortofemoral high-pitch spiral dual-source acquisition.\n\nPostprocessing was completed at a designated workstation (Syngo Multimodalitiy Workplace, Siemens healthineers, Erlangen, Germany).\n\n\nMRA Data Acquisition\n\nAll patients were examined using a 3T MRI system (Siemens Somatom Skyra, Siemens healthineers, Erlangen, Germany).Time-of-flight (TOF) MRA was used for the assessment of the femoral access route.The following scan parameters were applied: repetition time (TR) of 458 ms, echo time (TE) of 3.7 ms and flip angle of 50 • .The slice thickness was 3.5 mm.\n\n\nImage Review Methods\n\nTwo experienced readers (T.K., with 8 years of experience in both MRA and CTA, and P.R., with 3 years of experience in both MRA and CTA) independently evaluated the MRA measurements.They were blinded to the clinical findings, the medical histories of the patients and the CTA images.To avoid recall bias, the measurements for CTA were performed after a delay of two months; this was undertaken in consensus with the readers (T.K. and P.R.), who were blinded to the MRA measurements.\n\n\nAssessment of the Access Route\n\nOur study protocol for MRA focused on the iliofemoral vessels; thus, it did not include an assessment of the aorta.All measurements were obtained from the common iliac artery (CIA), the external iliac artery (EIA) and the common femoral artery (CFA) of the iliofemoral vessels on each side.The minimal effective diameter and area were assessed for each segment.Multiplanar reformation (MPR) was used for the measurements of the minimal effective diameter.Two planes were used to create a cross-sectional image that was orthogonal to the blood flow direction.The area was measured on the cross-sectional image at the site of maximal lumen narrowing (Figure 1).The minimal effective diameter was calculated using the following formula: minimal effective diameter = √ Area π * 2. The feasibility of transfemoral access was evaluated according to the minimum effective vessel diameter (>5 mm), stenosis grading and kinking, as well as the existence of a dissection (Figure 2).\n\nAll patients were examined using a 3T MRI system (Siemens Somatom Skyra, Siemens healthineers, Erlangen, Germany).Time-of-flight (TOF) MRA was used for the assessment of the femoral access route.The following scan parameters were applied: repetition time (TR) of 458 ms, echo time (TE) of 3.7 ms and flip angle of 50°.The slice thickness was 3.5 mm.\n\n\nImage Review Methods\n\nTwo experienced readers (T.K., with 8 years of experience in both MRA and CTA, and P.R., with 3 years of experience in both MRA and CTA) independently evaluated the MRA measurements.They were blinded to the clinical findings, the medical histories of the patients and the CTA images.To avoid recall bias, the measurements for CTA were performed after a delay of two months; this was undertaken in consensus with the readers (T.K. and P.R.), who were blinded to the MRA measurements.\n\n\nAssessment of the Access Route\n\nOur study protocol for MRA focused on the iliofemoral vessels; thus, it did not include an assessment of the aorta.All measurements were obtained from the common iliac artery (CIA), the external iliac artery (EIA) and the common femoral artery (CFA) of the iliofemoral vessels on each side.The minimal effective diameter and area were assessed for each segment.Multiplanar reformation (MPR) was used for the measurements of the minimal effective diameter.Two planes were used to create a crosssectional image that was orthogonal to the blood flow direction.The area was measured on the cross-sectional image at the site of maximal lumen narrowing (Figure 1).The minimal effective diameter was calculated using the following formula: minimal effective diameter = √ * 2.

4 indicated a good-quality image with a high signal without artifacts or only minor artifacts; 3 indicated a moderate-quality image with a weak signal, but the exclusion of relevant stenosis was possible; 2 indicated a low-quality image with a low signal or the presence of artifacts and where stenosis could not be ruled out; and 1 indicated a non-diagnostic image.\n\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nAll statistical analyses were performed using R (version 4.0.4).The continuous variables were presented as the mean and standard deviation.Differences in measurements were evaluated using Bland-Altman plots (mean difference ± 1.96 SD) and tested using Student's t-test or a Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate.The MRA and CTA measurements were correlated using Spearman's or Pearson's rank tests, as appropriate.Interobserver variabilities of measurements were calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) with a two-way model.A comparison of the feasibility of transfemoral access using MRA and CTA was performed using an agreement and Cohen's kappa.The irr package (version 0.84.1) was used to calculate the intraclass correlation coefficient and Cohen's kappa.A p-value below 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.\n\n\nImage Quality Assessment of MRA\n\nThe subjective image quality of TOF-MRA was graded by both observers using a semi-quantitative five-point scale.A grade of 5 indicated an excellent image quality with a high signal without artifacts;

this was also 5 for the CTA [ .In four patients, the image quality of the right transfemoral access route was inadequate for evaluation; three were due to artifacts in the CFA as a result of total endoprosthesis (TEP) of the hip.Similarly, when evaluating the left transfemoral access route, there were five patients with inadequate image quality; three were due to artifacts as a result of a hip TEP.For the evaluation of transfemoral access through the right CIA/EIA/CFA, the image quality (≥3) was adequate in 47/51 patients (92%); for the left CIA/EIA/CFA, the image quality was adequate in 46/51 (90%) patients.In 44/51 (86.3%) of patients, there was adequate image quality for a simultaneous evaluation of both the right and left sides (Table 2).\n\n\nEffective Vessel Diameter\n\nThere was a significant difference in the measurements of the effective vessel diameter between the MRA and CTA.The MRA underestimated the effective vessel diameter compared with the CTA (the effective vessel diameter in mm for the right transfemoral access route (CIA/EIA/CFA) MRA vs. CTA was 8.04 ± 1.46 vs. 8.37 ± 1.54 (p < 0.0001) and the left transfemoral access route (CIA/EIA/CFA) MRA vs. CTA was 8.07 ± 1.32 vs. 8.28 ± 1.34 (p < 0.0001)) (Table 3, Figures 3 and 4).The absolute difference between the MRA and CTA was small (Bland-Altman analysis of the right transfemoral access route (CIA/EIA/CFA) was −0.36 ± 0.77 mm (limits of agreement: −1.15; 1.87); Bland-Altman analysis of the left transfemoral access route (CIA/EIA/CFA) was −0.25 ± 0.61 mm (limits of agreement: 0.95; 1.44)).The overall correlation between the MRA and CTA measurements was very good (right transfemoral access route (CIA/EIA/CFA) Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.87 (p < 0.0001); left transfemoral access route (CIA/EIA/CFA) Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.9 (p < 0.0001)) (Table 3, Figures 3 and 4).The same observation was noted when separately analyzing each vessel segment (CIA, EIA and CFA) for the left and right sides (Table 3).The interobserver agreement was excellent for the MRA measurements of the effective vessel diameter, with an ICC of 0.867 (95% confidence interval: 0.819-0.902)for the right side and an ICC of 0.929 (95% confidence interval: 0.902-0.948)for the left side (Table 4).observation was noted when separately analyzing each vessel segment (CIA, EIA and CFA) for the left and right sides (Table 3).The interobserver agreement was excellent for the MRA measurements of the effective vessel diameter, with an ICC of 0.867 (95% confidence interval: 0.819-0.902)for the right side and an ICC of 0.929 (95% confidence interval: 0.902-0.948)for the left side (Table 4).Interobserver variability by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and lower and upper limits of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for interobserver variability of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) measurements.CIA: common iliac artery; EIA: external iliac artery; CFA: common femoral artery.\n\n\nFeasibility of Transfemoral Access\n\nThe agreement in terms of the feasibility of transfemoral access was high between the MRA and CTA (Table 5).According to the MRA, transfemoral access was possible through the right access route in 46 out of 47 patients compared with 51 out of 51 patients when using the CTA (agreement of 97.9%, Kohen's kappa was not applicable).Regarding the left access route, transfemoral access was possible in 44 out of 46 patients when using the MRA and 49 out of 51 patients when using the CTA (agreement of 95.7%, Kohen's Kappa: 0.477 (p = 0.001)).There was one case of a short dissection of the left common iliac artery (Figure 2), which was diagnosed using both the MRA and CTA.\n\n\nFeasibility of Transfemoral Access\n\nThe agreement in terms of the feasibility of transfemoral access was high between the MRA and CTA (Table 5).According to the MRA, transfemoral access was possible through the right access route in 46 out of 47 patients compared with 51 out of 51 patients when using the CTA (agreement of 97.9%, Kohen's kappa was not applicable).Regarding the left access route, transfemoral access was possible in 44 out of 46 patients when using the MRA and 49 out of 51 patients when using the CTA (agreement of 95.7%, Kohen's Kappa: 0.477 (p = 0.001)).There was one case of a short dissection of the left common iliac artery (Figure 2), which was diagnosed using both the MRA and CTA.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe main findings of this study were as follows:\n\n1.\n\nThe non-contrast MRA protocol was reliable for an assessment of the femoral access route prior to the TAVI in comparison with the gold-standard CTA for most of the patients.\n\n\n2.\n\nThe non-contrast TOF-MRA underestimated the minimal vessel diameter compared with the CTA, but the absolute differences were small and did not affect the evaluation of the feasibility of the transfemoral access.\n\nRecently, CTA has evolved as the gold standard for TAVI planning due to its capacity for the accurate visualization of aortic roots and access routes [5].The application of an intravenous iodinated contrast agent is required for CTA, which could worsen kidney functions and lead to acute or chronic kidney failure.As kidney failure is a known risk factor for a worse outcome after TAVI [8,11], an imaging approach without a contrast agent could benefit patients with reduced kidney function, leading to better overall outcomes after TAVI.Hence, a contrast-free MRA evaluation of the aortic root and access route prior to TAVI could be an alternative for these patients.A contrast-free approach could also benefit patients with severe allergies to iodinated contrast agents.Our previous study demonstrated the feasibility of aortic root measurements using non-contrast MRA for prosthesis sizing [8].An assessment of the access route was missing in this analysis.\n\n\nComparison with Different Non-Contrast MRA Techniques\n\nDifferent sequences for non-contrast MRA are available.TOF-MRA is one of the oldest non-contrast MRA techniques; it remains a common and widely used sequence for evaluations of carotid arteries [12,13].Newer techniques for the evaluation of peripheral artery disease, including quiescent-interval single-shot (QISS) MRA, have emerged; these benefit from shorter scan times and fewer image artifacts [12].Data evaluating vascular access in TAVI populations using non-contrast MRA are sparse.Studies that evaluated the QISS-MRA approach before TAVI were conducted, but these studies included significantly fewer patients (26 patients and 5 patients with 10 healthy volunteers, respectively) [14,15].To the best of our knowledge, our study had the largest patient cohort for the evaluation of vascular access anatomy before TAVI using non-contrast MRA.Our data revealed that TOF-MRA remains a viable option because the image quality was very good overall, with reasonable scan times.In 9 out of 102 access routes (9%), the image quality was inadequate for evaluation, mostly due to the artifacts of total hip prostheses (6/9 patients).Patients with a total hip prosthesis might not be suitable for a non-contrast MRA approach.This could be an important drawback to an MRA approach as a hip TEP is a common finding in elderly TAVI patients [16].\n\n\nFeasibility of Transfemoral Access Using MRA and CTA\n\nBased on the data from this study, the TOF-MRA underestimated the minimal vessel diameter compared with the CTA, but the absolute differences were small.This was in line with findings from a study that used QISS-MRA for the evaluation of transfemoral access routes, which revealed that the mean diameter of infrarenal aortas and iliofemoral vessels significantly differed [14], but the absolute differences were small and did not affect decisions regarding transfemoral access.One possible explanation for the consistent tendency toward a lower minimal vessel diameter when using MRA in our cohort in comparison with the CTA values might be the sensitivity of TOF-MRA to flow-related dephasing due to hemodynamically significant stenosis; this can lead to an overestimation of stenosis [12].An underestimation of the minimal vessel diameter may be less problematic in a clinical setting because if transfemoral TAVI access is deemed feasible using MRA, CTA would yield the same results.If, in future studies, TOF-MRA revealed a diameter of slightly less than the required minimum of 5.5 mm for the feasibility of transfemoral access, an evaluation using CTA might also consider transfemoral access to be possible.Our data revealed slightly higher minimal diameters; this should be taken into account in borderline scenarios in future studies when using TOF-MRA before considering alternative, and possibly riskier, access routes, such as transapical or trans-subclavian approaches.\n\nIn addition to an evaluation of the access route, CTA also offers the possibility of detecting the features of higher periprocedural risks that could influence the procedural strategy or even prompt advisement against TAVI.Multiple studies demonstrated that there is an association between higher periprocedural risks and these imaging-derived factors [6].Most of these features are related to the extent and location of calcification, especially within the left-ventricular outflow tract.This is related to the risk of an annular rupture, as well as paravalvular leakage and calcification of the aortic arch, which is related to the risk of a periprocedural stroke [6].The visualization of calcification in MRI can be challenging; currently, there are no data for the prediction of periprocedural risks based on MRA.One study proposed the use of a native CT scan of the thorax in addition to non-contrast MRA to assess calcification and exclude any high-risk features [17].\n\n\nContrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury\n\nThe risk of the development of an acute kidney injury after CTA prior to TAVI is higher for patients with pre-existing kidney disease and when higher volumes of an intravenous iodinated contrast agent are applied [18].Recently, published data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology National Cardiovascular Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry comprising data from 107,814 patients revealed that an acute kidney injury following TAVI remained a common finding and occurred in more than ten percent of patients [9].Patients who developed a stage 3 acute kidney injury according to the acute kidney injury network criteria [19] had a seven-fold higher adjusted one-year mortality compared with patients who did not develop an acute kidney injury.Although the risk of a contrast-induced acute kidney injury following exposure to an intravenous iodinated contrast agent was overstated in the past for patients with normal or only mildly impaired renal functions, patients with severe kidney disease are considered to be at risk, as stated by consensus statements from the American College of Radiology and the National Kidney Foundation [20].In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 4 or 5 (eGFRs of 15-29 mL/min/1.73m 2 or 15 mL/min/1.73m 2 , respectively), the potential risks and benefits, as well as alternative imaging strategies, should be carefully considered before performing contrast-enhanced computed tomography.The guidelines recommend volume expansion using normal saline as a prophylaxis in these patients to prevent an acute kidney injury prior to the administration of intravenous iodinated contrast media [20].This recommendation cannot generally be applied to patients with severe aortic stenosis, as it could lead to the worsening of heart failure.Patients with chronic kidney disease stages 4 or 5 may benefit from a contrast-free imaging approach.Recently, there have been advances in performing the TAVI procedure itself without a contrast medium.A pilot study of 25 patients revealed that contrast-free transcatheter aortic valve implantation was feasible and safe [21].These findings require confirmation using larger studies.A contrast-free TAVI procedure should be accompanied by a contrast-free imaging approach pre-TAVI.Non-contrast magnetic resonance angiography could be the ideal imaging modality to replace contrast-enhanced computed tomography in a zero-contrast approach for TAVI, as it permits the 3D visualization and reconstruction of the access route and has demonstrated promising results in recent studies.\n\n\nStudy Limitations\n\nAlthough the patient cohort in this study was one of the largest on the subject of using MRA for the assessment of iliofemoral access routes prior to TAVI, the number of study participants was low in comparison with the data available from studies using CTA.The study protocol for MRA did not include an assessment of the aorta; contraindications on the level of the aorta (for example, severe kinking of the aorta) could not be evaluated using MRA.\n\nLonger scan times when using MRA, especially TOF-MRA, might hinder its application for certain patients, especially older and more frail patients, where lying calmly in a supine position without moving for a long time might be difficult.Those patients might benefit from faster MRA sequences with shorter scan times, as provided by QISS-MRA.\n\nThe non-contrast MRA evaluation of transfemoral access is a promising approach for patients with chronic kidney disease who are referred for TAVI.Whether this translates into better outcomes for these patients is unclear, as there are no randomized data currently available on this subject.MRA is a more time-consuming and expensive technique compared with CTA; a substantial benefit to the patient would need to be demonstrated to justify its use.Further prospective, preferably randomized, studies are required before non-contrast MRA can be recommended for broader applications.In this context, data from an ongoing randomized trial are eagerly awaited [22].\n\nFigure 1 .Figure 1 .\n11\nFigure 1.Exemplary MRA in multiplanar reformation showing angulation of two planes (A,B) at the site of the right external iliac artery to create a cross-sectional image perpendicular to the blood flow (C).Area was measured at the site of maximal lumen narrowing and minimal effective diameter was calculated as described above.(D) A 3D reconstruction of iliac vessels in MPR.\n\n\nJ 12 Figure 2 .\n122\nFigure 2.

2023anthocyaninsextractionstructureanti-degradationbioavailabilityprevent disease\nAnthocyanins are natural flavonoid polyphenolic compounds widely found in fruits and vegetables.They exhibit antioxidant properties and prophylactic effects in the immune and cardiovascular systems, confer protection against cancer, and contribute to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.Thus, their incorporation into functional foods, pharmaceuticals, supplements, and cosmetic formulations aims at promoting human well-being.This review comprehensively outlined the structural attributes of anthocyanins, expanding upon diverse methodologies employed for their extraction and production.Additionally, the stability, metabolic pathways, and manifold physiological functions of anthocyanins were discussed.However, their constrained fat solubility, susceptibility to instability, and restricted bioavailability collectively curtail their applicability and therapeutic efficacy.Consequently, a multidimensional approach was imperative, necessitating the exploration of innovative pathways to surmount these limitations, thereby amplifying the utilitarian significance of anthocyanins and furnishing pivotal support for their continual advancement and broader application.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAnthocyanins are a class of natural pigments renowned for their bright color and health-promoting attributes, conferring multifaceted benefits to human well-being [1].These compounds showed robust antioxidant properties, orchestrating a modulation of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses [2].Furthermore, their cancer-preventive potential, cardiovascular regulatory capacity, vision enhancement, as well as antibacterial and anti-inflammatory functionalities have been substantiated [3].Given the diverse physiological functions of anthocyanins, they were widely applied to functional foods, supplements, and pharmaceuticals.Various analytical methodologies, encompassing ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) [4], UV-visible spectroscopy, and liquid chromatography [5], among others, have been used in unveiling the intricate structural and compositional facets of anthocyanins.The techniques used for anthocyanin extraction and synthesis are also diverse and important.Although the sources, extraction, and characterization were previously summarized [6], this review not only delved into these characterization and preparation avenues and scrutinized their merits and limitations, but also comprehensively discussed the stability, metabolism, and physiological function of anthocyanins.\n\nThe stability of anthocyanins is relatively weak, as their susceptibility to degradation under light and during thermal food processing [7].To combat this, bolstering anthocyanin stability necessitated a comprehensive exploration of factors impacting their degradation,\n\nThe stability of anthocyanins is relatively weak, as their susceptibility to degradation under light and during thermal food processing [7].To combat this, bolstering anthocyanin stability necessitated a comprehensive exploration of factors impacting their degradation, coupled with structural modifications to preserve both color integrity and nutritional potency.The low bioavailability of anthocyanins underscored the importance of comprehending their digestion, absorption, and metabolic dynamics within the human body, a facet that is dissected in subsequent sections [8].\n\nThis paper discussed varied preparation methodologies including solvent extraction, ultrasonic extraction, and genetic engineering, all of which endowed anthocyanins with pivotal physiological attributes, spanning antioxidative potential, immunomodulation, cancer mitigation, and cardiovascular homeostasis (Figure 1).This comprehensive study amalgamated insights into the structural attributes of anthocyanins, their preparation protocols, stability profiles, in vivo metabolic trajectories, and an array of physiological functionalities.By encapsulating these multifarious dimensions, this article aspired to lay a robust theoretical foundation to propel the application of anthocyanins across diverse domains, encompassing food, medical intervention, cosmetics, etc.\n\n\nMolecular Structure of Anthocyanins\n\nThe molecular structure of anthocyanins varies, owing to their widespread presence in the cells of numerous plant species, spanning 27 families and 73 genera, and encompassing diverse plant organs such as roots, stems, leaves, and fruits [9].Anthocyanins, extensively identified in sources like grape seeds, blueberries, purple kale, hawthorn, and tea leaves, exhibit a distinctive framework denoted as the C6-C3-C6 skeleton structure.Anthocyanins are a class of flavonoid polyphenol compounds characterized by a 2-phenylchromen ring adorned with various substituents [10].\n\nThe basic structure of the anthocyanins consists of two benzene rings, namely A and B, tethered together by an oxygenated pyrene ring, typically referred to as ring C. The 3-, 5-, and 7-carbon positions of the anthocyanin moiety often feature substituted hydroxyl groups.It is the assortment of substituents at the R1 and R2 carbon positions that gives rise to a plethora of anthocyanin varieties.Remarkably, over 20 distinct anthocyanin types\n\n\nMolecular Structure of Anthocyanins\n\nThe molecular structure of anthocyanins varies, owing to their widespread presence in the cells of numerous plant species, spanning 27 families and 73 genera, and encompassing diverse plant organs such as roots, stems, leaves, and fruits [9].Anthocyanins, extensively identified in sources like grape seeds, blueberries, purple kale, hawthorn, and tea leaves, exhibit a distinctive framework denoted as the C 6 -C 3 -C 6 skeleton structure.Anthocyanins are a class of flavonoid polyphenol compounds characterized by a 2-phenylchromen ring adorned with various substituents [10].\n\nThe basic structure of the anthocyanins consists of two benzene rings, namely A and B, tethered together by an oxygenated pyrene ring, typically referred to as ring C. The 3-, 5-, and 7-carbon positions of the anthocyanin moiety often feature substituted hydroxyl groups.It is the assortment of substituents at the R 1 and R 2 carbon positions that gives rise to a plethora of anthocyanin varieties.Remarkably, over 20 distinct anthocyanin types have been identified, with particular focus on six extensively investigated ones: Pelargonidin (Pg), Cyanidin (Cy), Delphinidin (Dp), Peonidin (Pn), Petunidin (Pt), and Malvidin (My) [11].Owing to their multiple phenolic hydroxyl groups, anthocyanins predominantly exist in a glycosidic form, commonly bonded to one or more sugars such as glucose, galactose, or xylose.These glycosidic bonds typically form at the C 3 position of the C ring and the C 5 and C 7 positions of the A ring.Furthermore, beyond glycosylation, anthocyanins have the capacity to engage in acylation, a chemical process in which they bind with aromatic acids.This acylation phenomenon typically occurs at the C 3 position of the C ring, forming acylated anthocyanins.This multiplicity in structural modifications accounts for the existence of more than 500 identified anthocyanin-derived compounds, endowing anthocyanins with a broad spectrum of structural characteristics and physicochemical properties [10].\n\n\nPhysicochemical Properties of Anthocyanins\n\nThe physicochemical properties of anthocyanins are a function of their intricate molecular structure, featuring a dual benzene ring configuration and a densely packed molecular system.This molecular composition imparts notable polarity to anthocyanins, rendering them readily soluble in water and easily dissolvable in polar solvents such as methanol, ethanol, acetone, dilute alkali, and dilute acid, while they remain insoluble in nonpolar substances like ether, chloroform, and benzene.This solubility profile, coupled with their limited lipid solubility, contributes to their diminished ability to traverse phospholipid bilayers, thus resulting in reduced bioavailability [12,13].\n\nWhen anthocyanins are extracted from botanical sources, they exhibit an exceptional susceptibility to degradation.This degradation is affected by various factors including acidity, temperature, their own concentration, exposure to light, oxygen, enzymatic activity, cofactors, microorganisms, and metal ions [14].Consequently, the application of anthocyanins is somewhat restricted due to their inherent instability.As pigments, anthocyanins manifest distinct colors contingent upon pH levels.Specifically, they assume a red hue at pH values below 7, transition to purple in the pH range of 7 to 8, and appear blue when exposed to pH levels exceeding 11.This property underpins their ability to impart red, orange, purple, and blue hues to plant organs such as petals, fruits, and leaves.It is imperative to note that anthocyanins retain stability only in acidic conditions with a pH less than or equal to 3. At concentrations of hydrochloric acid equal to or greater than 0.12 mol•L −1 , partial hydrolysis of anthocyanins occurs.Hence, during the extraction, isolation, or purification of anthocyanins, meticulous attention should be directed toward monitoring the concentration of hydrochloric acid.Moreover, alterations in pH can modulate the color intensity and chromaticity of anthocyanins without compromising the characteristic spectra of interfering substances [15].Anthocyanins exhibit strong UV and visible region absorbance, with the maximum absorption wavelength occurring in the UV region and another peak in the visible region.This dual absorption feature, with its respective peaks at approximately 500-540 and 275 nm, is indicative of their spectral properties [16].In their capacity as food colorants, anthocyanins possess a commendable safety profile, being non-toxic, non-allergenic, non-teratogenic, and non-carcinogenic.\n\nThe structural and compositional adaptability of anthocyanins allows for modifications, and enhanced comprehension of their structure, physicochemical attributes, and pharmacological effects empowers the development and production of analogous anthocyaninlike compounds.Significant alterations in the physicochemical properties of anthocyanins accompany structural or compositional changes.Various analytical techniques were developed for the quality and quantity of anthocyanins (Figure 2).UV-visible spectroscopy, a simple and cost-effective method, offers qualitative identification and quantitative determination of straightforward mixture systems [5].Paper chromatography and thin-layer chromatography, employing basic equipment, enable swift qualitative identification of uncomplicated mixture systems.For more intricate analyses, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and UHPLC come to the fore [4].These methods allow qualitative identification and precise quantification of anthocyanins with exceptional speed and sensitivity, albeit at a higher operational cost.In the case of highly polar, thermally unstable, and challenging-to-volatilize high-purity samples, mass spectrometry provides a powerful qualitative analysis tool, distinguished by its sensitivity and stability.Meanwhile, NMR spectroscopy, though characterized by a longer turnaround time and reduced sensitivity, facilitates the qualitative identification of unknown anthocyanins, isomeric compounds, and complex acylated anthocyanins within natural products.Infrared Spectroscopy, offering high specificity, enables the qualitative identification of anthocyanins containing benzene rings, oxygen-containing heterocycles, sugars, hydroxyl groups, and methoxy groups [17].This method, marked by its expeditious nature, does come with a comparatively larger relative error.Given the multifaceted nature of anthocyanin analysis, employing a single technique proves insufficient for the precise description of their structure and composition.Consequently, a combination of multiple analytical methodologies is often necessitated to enhance accuracy.liquid chromatography (HPLC) and UHPLC come to the fore [4].These methods allow

accuracy.\n\n\nExtraction and Production of Anthocyanins\n\nThe extraction and production of anthocyanins involve a range of methods, from tra ditional solvent extraction to advanced techniques like supercritical fluid extraction.Ul trasonic and microwave methods expedite the process, while pressurized solvent extrac tion improves efficiency.Enzyme extraction, fermentation, and genetic engineering offer innovative avenues for the production of anthocyanin.These extraction methods and pro duction processes of anthocyanins are summarized in Table 1.\n\n\nExtraction and Production of Anthocyanins\n\nThe extraction and production of anthocyanins involve a range of methods, from traditional solvent extraction to advanced techniques like supercritical fluid extraction.Ultrasonic and microwave methods expedite the process, while pressurized solvent extraction improves efficiency.Enzyme extraction, fermentation, and genetic engineering offer innovative avenues for the production of anthocyanin.These extraction methods and production processes of anthocyanins are summarized in Table 1.\n\n\nSolvent Extraction\n\nThe solvent extraction of anthocyanins leverages their solubility to effectively recover these compounds from plant sources, like purple potatoes, pomegranates, and grapes.Consequently, reagents featuring enhanced solubility for anthocyanins, such as methanol, ethanol, acetone, and other polar solvents, are conventionally employed in the extraction process.Furthermore, given the heightened stability of anthocyanins in acidic environments, acidic solutions are typically employed as extractants.Methanol and citric acid have been determined as the optimal extractant choices [18].Nevertheless, the drawbacks of Foods 2023, 12, 3969 5 of 26 organic solvents, including heightened environmental impact and challenging recovery processes, have spurred the predominant utilization of water-based extraction methods in practical applications.In practice, a pragmatic approach often involves harnessing the respective advantages of both water and organic solvents through a combination of multiple methods for anthocyanin extraction.This multifaceted approach serves to enhance the efficiency of anthocyanin extraction and bolster the safety of the overall extraction process.\n\nTable 1.The extraction and production method of anthocyanins.\n\n\nMethod\n\n\nRaw Material Advantages and Disadvantages References\n\n\nSolvent extraction\n\nSenggani fruit minimize damage or loss of compounds; low yield, low product quality, high energy input, time-consuming, need substantial amounts of solvents [18] Ultrasonic extraction rose flower petal significantly improve anthocyanins extraction rate, efficient; require complex and expensive equipment, difficult to realize industrialization [19,20] Microwave extraction the fruits of Syzygium nervosum (ma-kiang in Thai)\n\ngreen, rapid extraction time, higher extraction rate, with less organic solvent, wastewater removal, and energy use [20,21] Supercritical fluid extraction method fruit wastes green, reduced cost of operation; high cost, have limits to realize industrialization [22] Pressurized solvent extraction black mulberry (Morus nigra L.) pulp require less methanol consumption, higher extraction efficiency [23] Enzyme extraction grape skins enhance the yield, effective and environmentally friendly [24] Genetic engineering Corynebacterium glutamicum a sustainable method to produce anthocyanins, ease of cultivation and fast growth, availability of sophisticated genetic tools, and well-defined metabolic networks and models; the heterologous expression of plant-derived genes, optimal expression depends on the host strains [25]\n\n\nUltrasonic Extraction\n\nUltrasonic extraction methodology capitalizes on ultrasonic waves to facilitate plant hydration, resulting in the expansion of cell wall pores rupture.This effect serves to enhance the interaction between the extractant and anthocyanins, thereby augmenting the extraction efficiency [6].The merits of ultrasonic-assisted extraction encompass the reduction in extractant volume, shortened extraction durations, and diminished environmental pollutant output associated with the extractant.Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that at lower ultrasonic frequencies, there is a discernible elevation in anthocyanin extraction efficiency.Conversely, as ultrasonic frequency and duration increase, a portion of the anthocyanins undergo degradation.This degradation phenomenon primarily arises from the conversion of vibrational energy into heat during the extraction process.Given the heightened sensitivity of anthocyanins to elevated temperatures, this process can lead to the degradation of a portion of the anthocyanin [19].\n\n\nMicrowave Extraction\n\nMicrowave extraction is a method that uses microwave radiation to heat a sample solvent mixture to extract anthocyanins.This method uses microwave energy to rapidly, efficiently, and uniformly heat plant cells containing water, consequently inducing cell division [21].This cell division leads to cell rupture, which allows for a more complete interaction between the cell contents and the extractant, potentially reducing both the extraction time and the volume of solvent required.Additionally, the elevation in temperature engenders an augmented diffusion effect, further enhancing the overall extraction efficiency.Pattrathip et al. [20] identified optimal parameters for microwave extraction, which included an ethanol concentration of 55%, a microwave power setting of 140 W, an extraction duration of 45 s, and the repetition of the extraction process eight times.It should be noted, however, that the application of microwave extraction is significantly limited by the inherent temperature sensitivity of anthocyanins.To reduce the risk of overheating and prevent the degradation of anthocyanins, medium power settings and longer extraction durations are often used.\n\n\nSupercritical Fluid Extraction Method\n\nSupercritical fluid extraction of anthocyanins is a technique that exploits the influence of pressure and temperature on the solubility of supercritical fluids for the selective extraction of specific constituents from solid or liquid matrices [22].Prior to the extraction process, a pre-treatment of the sample with supercritical CO 2 effectively eliminates the non-polar fraction of the solution, thereby reducing the presence of interfering substances.The union of CO 2 and water culminates in the formation of carbonic acid, eliminating the need for additional acid addition to the solution and eliminating redundant steps for recovery and purification.The production process of this method meets strict safety standards and is free of toxic elements, making the resulting product suitable for use as a food additive.This process limits the exposure of anthocyanins to atmospheric conditions and light, thereby reducing their susceptibility to oxidative degradation.In addition, it is noteworthy that, despite the potential for higher temperature application in anthocyanin extraction, the prevailing majority of researchers have refrained from utilizing temperatures exceeding 40 • C in the course of their experiments involving this methodology [18].Nevertheless, it is imperative to acknowledge certain limitations associated with this method, particularly its elevated production costs.\n\n\nPressurized Solvent Extraction\n\nThe process of pressurized solvent extraction, in which high pressure is employed to maintain the liquid phase at temperatures surpassing the boiling point, serves to disrupt hydrogen bonds between molecules while preserving the non-polar attributes of water molecules [26].Simultaneously, this method enhances the solubility of compounds, diminishes solvent viscosity and surface tension, and heightens sample wetting and matrix penetration [23].Given the application of the method at elevated temperatures, it is imperative to recognize the increased susceptibility of anthocyanins to temperature-induced degradation.Consequently, a delicate equilibrium must be upheld to optimize the anthocyanin yield while minimizing its thermal degradation.Despite the inherent limitations of this approach, its potential for streamlined and automated production holds immense appeal, particularly within the sphere of industrial manufacturing.Consequently, it has found widespread application in the extraction processes of numerous food products.\n\n\nEnzyme Extraction\n\nThe enzyme-based extraction method relies on the use of microorganisms or their enzymatic by-products, taking advantage of the remarkable specificity inherent in enzymatic reactions.This specificity facilitates the targeted degradation and separation of specific constituents within the cell walls of anthocyanin-containing cells.This enzymatic action disrupts the structural integrity of plant cell walls, thereby fully exposing the bioactive components and, ultimately, increasing the efficiency and yield of anthocyanin extraction.Since cellulose is the major component of most plant cell walls and serves as the primary barrier to the dissolution of bioactive compounds within these walls, cellulase is the most commonly used enzyme to promote the dissolution of anthocyanins by disrupting the cellulose barrier, thereby improving the extraction rate of anthocyanins [24].\n\n\nFermentation\n\nCurrently, the predominant source of anthocyanins is extraction from natural plants, a method that is widely used but is susceptible to variability due to natural factors such as season, geographic region, and plant growth and development [27].When large amounts of anthocyanins are required, synthetic methods need to be considered.Because the chemical synthesis principle of anthocyanin is not yet clear, the traditional chemical synthesis method is not suitable for the production of anthocyanin [28].Currently, fermentation has emerged as a prominent method for anthocyanin synthesis.This approach utilizes cellular fermentation processes to generate cellular metabolites, which are subsequently extracted to obtain the desired product.\n\nIn terms of anthocyanin synthetic pathways, particular attention has been paid to the production of anthocyanins by plant tissues or cell cultures [29].Plants inherently possess the genetic blueprint for anthocyanin synthesis and are adept at producing anthocyanins and a spectrum of anthocyanin derivatives.The use of careful screening and rejuvenation techniques for high-yielding cell lines can lead to significant increases, often multiples or even tens of times, in the production of the target product.For instance, Vincenzo et al. [30] reported that cell cultures of potatoes exhibited three to five times higher total anthocyanin levels than their tubers of the same variety.This approach also avoids the waste of non-essential plant parts and facilitates the conversion of plant-derived compounds into more potent pharmaceuticals.Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge the inherent challenges associated with tissue culture, including production instability, variable yields across generations, and product variability.\n\nFurthermore, addressing the intricacies of natural product biosynthesis involves optimizing bioreactor variables such as light exposure, impeller design, and sample extraction methods [31].Parameters like medium composition, airflow rate, agitation rate, light conditions, and temperature must be fine-tuned to enhance the biosynthetic yield of anthocyanins [32].Controlling the conditions of plant tissue culture is an effective strategy to increase anthocyanin production.For instance, sugar content exhibited a positive correlation with anthocyanin production in cells.Elevated sugar-induced anthocyanin accumulation results from altered expression of regulatory and structural genes, particularly UDP-glucose and anthocyanin 3-O-glycosyltransferase, coupled with substantial reprogramming of signal transduction pathways [33].Light conditions also exert profound effects on anthocyanin production, with blue light rapidly stimulating anthocyanin accumulation in fruits, while red light fosters proanthocyanidin synthesis by inducing LAR and ANR [34].Temperature is also critical, requiring higher temperatures for cell propagation to accommodate cell development and growth, and lower temperatures for anthocyanin production to prevent tissue browning and protect anthocyanins from oxidation or thermal decomposition [35].\n\nWhile the plant tissue culture method holds considerable promise, it is not without its challenges.For instance, the issue of yield instability across generations in tissue culture remains contentious and unresolved.The demanding culture conditions required for plant tissue culture impose a significant cost burden.Plant cells produce multiple anthocyanins, making their separation a formidable task using current extraction and purification techniques.Moreover, the presence of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) catalyzes oxidation, leading to an undesirable \"browning effect\" in plant anthocyanin extracts, culminating in the unwanted amalgamation of resulting compounds into brown pigments [31].Xiran et al. [36] explored four major classes of inhibitors to mitigate enzymatic browning reactions, offering protective inhibition against these reactions.\n\n\nGenetic Engineering\n\nThe rapid development of recombinant DNA technology, genome sequencing, DNA synthesis, metabolic network modeling, and the growing importance of enzymology have paved the way for metabolic engineering as a potent biotechnological tool for the production of industrially important compounds by microorganisms.The use of microbial cell factories for anthocyanin production has the potential to effectively overcome the current obstacles associated with the extraction and purification of natural anthocyanins.Anthocyanins are commonly synthesized by Escherichia coli [37], Saccharomyces cerevisiae [37], and Corynebacterium glutamicum [25].\n\nIn addition, flavonols are converted to dihydroflavonols, leucine anthocyanins, and, finally, to anthocyanins through the action of a series of enzymes, including flavonol 3-hydroxylase (F3H), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (Dfr), and α-ketoglutarate and iron (II)-dependent anthocyanin synthesis enzymes (Ans) [38].The production of anthocyanins in microbial systems is closely correlated with the construction of anthocyanin synthetic pathways and the enzymes that control anthocyanin metabolism.Due to the conserved nature of these gene-edited enzymes and their regulation across different organisms, the expression levels of enzymes from different plant sources differ [39].Brady et al. [40] successfully co-expressed anthocyanin O-methyltransferase (AOMT) from different plant origins with Petunia anthocyanin synthase (PhANS) and Arabidopsis anthocyanin 3-Oglucosyltransferase (At3GT) in Escherichia coli, resulting in a substantial 21-fold increase in O-methylated anthocyanin titers using plasmid copies.Additionally, cofactors play a pivotal role in anthocyanin synthesis, primarily facilitating electron transfer and enzyme activation.Modulation of these cofactors is often achieved by overexpression of synthetic genes and suppression of catabolic genes [40].\n\nDespite the significant progress, the production of anthocyanins by recombinant microorganisms grapples with several challenges arising from the absence of various native plant environments, such as plant cell inclusion bodies and intracellular pH fluctuations.Moreover, the intricate internal environment that governs plant growth and development poses an additional challenge.For example, while engineered bacteria offer rapid growth times, standardized genetic procedures, and easily scalable culture conditions, their anthocyanin production still carries substantial costs and yields lower titers compared to natural anthocyanins [41].Furthermore, anthocyanins produced by engineered bacteria face stability issues due to the absence of pH regulation mechanisms inherent in plant cells and vesicles.\n\n\nStability of Anthocyanins\n\n\nLight Stability\n\nThe conjugated double bond in anthocyanin gives the aromatic acyl group of the anthocyanin molecule the ability to absorb light energy and potentially release electrons.When the photon is absorbed by the anthocyanin molecule and breaks the conjugated double bond in the anthocyanin molecule, photodegradation occurs and the aromatic acyl group in acylated anthocyanins absorbs photons and reduces the sensitivity of the acylated anthocyanins to light [42].Natural anthocyanins predominantly exist as colored flavin oxygen ions (AH + ) in acidic media (pH < 2.5).However, as the H + concentration of the solution decreases (pH > 3), the predominant form transitions to hemiacetal B, leading to a gradual shift in anthocyanin coloration toward colorlessness or pale yellow.Subsequently, the hemiacetal can undergo ring-opening and isomerization into cis-hydroxychalcone or (Z)-hydroxychalcone, both of which lack color.These compounds can further isomerize into (E)-chalcone through thermal or photochemical processes [43].In the excited state, both uncomplexed and complexed anthocyanins undergo efficient and rapid deactivation via two primary pathways: excited state intermolecular proton transfer (ESPT) in free anthocyanins and charge transfer-mediated internal conversion in cochromatic anthocyanins [44].Furthermore, exposure to light can deactivate these colorless hydration products upon UV excitation.\n\nThe pH of the solution containing anthocyanins significantly influences their photochemical degradation due to its effect on the form of the anthocyanins [45].In acidic media, anthocyanins exhibit relatively higher stability under light, with chemically modified anthocyanins, such as acylated anthocyanins, demonstrating superior stability compared to their unacylated counterparts.Hu et al. [46] conducted experiments with four anthocyanins Foods 2023, 12, 3969 9 of 26 extracted from black wolfberry and Tangut white spurge.In a pH 3 solution, under light conditions at 35 • C for 10 days, unacylated anthocyanins from Lycium barbarum maintained 79% preservation in the dark and 64% preservation in the light, whereas acylated anthocyanins from Tangut white spurge retained nearly 90% of their content in the light.\n\nHowever, the number of acyl groups in anthocyanins does not always show a direct positive correlation with their stability.Escher et al. [47] studied the effect of pH and light on blue pea anthocyanins, which contain significant amounts of polyacylated anthocyanins.They were stored in solutions at pH 3.6 and 5.4 in a photooxidation chamber at 32 ± 2 • C.Under light conditions, the anthocyanin retention rate was 34.4% and 48.3%, respectively, and anthocyanin retention in solutions kept in darkness exceeded 90%.Furthermore, the light stability of anthocyanins is influenced by additives in the solution.For instance, ascorbic acid has a scavenging effect on peroxide radicals formed by anthocyanins under light stress.Under the protective influence of ascorbic acid, the degradation rates of both acylated and non-acylated anthocyanins under light show different degrees of reduction [7].Song et al. [48] reported that the addition of 100 ppm of ascorbic acid under light stress at 500 W/m 2 min −1 reduced the degradation rates of purple sweet potato anthocyanin and grape anthocyanin from 2.739 × 10 −3 to 1.589 × 10 −3 min −1 , highlighting the protective role of ascorbic acid against anthocyanin degradation.\n\nIn summary, chemical modifications are required to improve the light stability of anthocyanins.The pH of the solution, additives, and storage conditions must be taken into account to ensure the rational use of anthocyanins.\n\n\nThermal Stability\n\nAnthocyanins, as food-based pigments, are inevitably subjected to various thermal processes during food processing, such as pasteurization, which serves to prevent spoilage and deterioration.Consequently, understanding the effect of temperature on anthocyanins is an important facet of understanding anthocyanin stability.In general, anthocyanins exhibit considerable instability, with thermal processes exceeding 50 • C resulting in partial or complete degradation.The thermal stability of anthocyanins is further influenced by the acidity level of the solution in which they reside, with relative thermal stability observed below pH 3 and increased instability at neutral pH levels [47,49].\n\nAnthocyanins can be categorized into monomers, zwitterions, and polymers based on their degree of polymerization.Monomers represent the fundamental structural units, zwitterions consist of 2-10 monomers, and polymers comprise more than 10 monomers, all characterized by unsaturated double bonds.These structural features make anthocyanins susceptible to degradation at elevated temperatures, and their thermal stability is closely linked to specific chemical structures [50].Two hypotheses have been proposed regarding the degradation mechanism of anthocyanins.Connor et al. [51] postulated that anthocyanins transform into base-like glucosides, which subsequently open to form chalcone glycosides.These compounds further evolve, giving rise to chalcone and its isomer α-diketone, eventually culminating in the formation of phenolic acids, aldehydes, cyano-3-glucoside, and geranyl-3-glucoside.This hypothesis suggests that the initiation of anthocyanin degradation involves the opening of heterocycles and chalcone formation, a process intensified by elevated temperatures.Another hypothesis suggests that the thermal degradation of anthocyanins begins with the hydrolysis of C 3 glycosides, resulting in the synthesis of anthocyanins that mimic bases.Subsequent isomerization results in chalcone and its isomer α-diketone.The chalcone structure is then subject to further transformation, giving rise to coumarin glucoside derivatives.Eventually, this transformation causes the B-ring to be lost [52].Furthermore, alterations in solution pH cause changes in the form of anthocyanins in solution and, subsequently, shift the thermal degradation pathway of these compounds.In summary, anthocyanins undergo degradation via two pathways, ultimately yielding aldehyde and benzoic acid derivatives or chalcone and coumarin, respectively.\n\nDifferent heat treatment conditions applied to anthocyanins have varying degrees of influence on their degradation, significantly impacting the anthocyanin content of the final products.Mahsa et al. [53] observed a 20% reduction in anthocyanin absorbance when heated to 85 • C, and a 53% reduction at 95 • C. Burgos et al. [54] also found that total anthocyanin content decreased by 23% after heating for 20-25 min and by half after heating at 121 • C for 10 min.Moreover, the use of microwave treatment significantly reduced the anthocyanin content.In summary, various heating methods have a prominent impact on the half-life of anthocyanins.\n\nCertain additives can improve the thermal stability of anthocyanins and protect their integrity at high temperatures.Factors such as metal ions, ascorbic acid, sugar, and proteins can impact the stability of anthocyanins.Kopjar et al. [55] investigated the prevention of thermal degradation of anthocyanins in blackberry juice through the addition of sugar, specifically sucrose, fructose, dextrose, and alginate, at varying concentrations.The juice samples were heated at 50 • C, 70 • C, and 90 • C for 1 and 2 h.The protective effect was assessed based on the degradation rate of anthocyanins.Alginate exhibited the greatest impact on anthocyanin stability, with samples containing added alginate exhibiting the lowest reaction rate and the longest half-life.Furthermore, proteins can enhance the stability of anthocyanins.Wu et al. [56] investigated the effect of yeast mannose protein on the thermal stability of anthocyanins at pH 7.0.The primary kinetics results indicate that there is degradation of anthocyanins at both 80 • C and 126 • C. The inclusion of mannose protein, however, extended the half-life of anthocyanins by 4-5 times after being heated for 30 min at 80 • C and 126 • C, while sustaining their antioxidant capacity.\n\nIn brief, comprehension of how anthocyanins degrade at varying pH and temperature levels plays a critical role in minimizing such degradation during heat-based procedures (Figure 3).Additionally, incorporating the right additives can improve the thermal stability of anthocyanins, thus preserving their color and nutritional qualities.\n\n\nMetabolism of Anthocyanins\n\n\nIntake of Anthocyanins\n\nAnthocyanins are present mostly in numerous fruits from certain plants, with predominant quantities in different grains and vegetables (such as eggplant, beans, cabbage, radish, and onions) along with an assortment of fruits such as strawberries, red cherries, plums, blackberries, raspberries, red currants, grapes, and blackcurrants.These compounds are primarily absorbed by the human body through the digestive tract [10].Anthocyanins are commonly found in plant pulps but can also occur in the skin of fruits [57].Their intake is closely linked to individual dietary habits, as the type and concentration of anthocyanins can vary among different foods.\n\nUpon entering the oral cavity, anthocyanins initiate their journey through the digestive tract.Here, they undergo digestion and absorption into the bloodstream.The low bioavailability of anthocyanins, with plasma concentrations typically around 1% of consumption, may be attributed to the diverse range of digestive enzymes present in the digestive tract.Mallery et al. [58] discovered that consumption of black raspberry anthocyanins by healthy volunteers led to hydrolysis into their glycosidic form via B-glycosidases produced by both oral epithelial cells and bacteria.These conversion reactions, occurring during the brief period that food remains in the oral cavity, had a minimal impact on anthocyanin degradation.\n\nThe stomach is a crucial site for food digestion in the human gastrointestinal tract.It secretes digestive juices that contain acids and enzymes responsible for breaking down food [59].Studies suggest that gastric acidity has little effect on anthocyanin degradation.Pepsin, an enzyme that turns protein molecules into peptides/amino acids, may have a limited effect on anthocyanin degradation, mainly by binding and reducing the anthocyanin content.The composition of gastric microbiota in healthy individuals is dynamic and influenced by various factors such as diet, medications, and disease.However, the effect of gastric microbiota on anthocyanin degradation and metabolism remains largely unexplored.It was found that anthocyanins can be absorbed through the stomach, and the absorption rate of anthocyanins is affected by factors such as culture time, pH conditions, anthocyanin structure, and molecular weight [60][61][62].\n\nAny anthocyanins that are not metabolized and absorbed in the stomach move on to the intestine, which is the primary location for food digestion and nutrient absorption.The intestinal epithelium expresses several transporter proteins that facilitate the transfer of digested nutrients from the intestinal lumen to the bloodstream.These transporter proteins encompass hexose transporter proteins, ATP-binding transporter proteins (ABC), and monocarboxylate transporter proteins (MCT) [63].Baron et al. [64] examined the pharmacokinetic profile of lingonberry anthocyanins in rats and their absorption via intestinal epithelial glucose transport proteins (sGLT1 and GLUT2).They found that after 30 min of ingestion, the peak blood concentration of anthocyanins in rats reached 11.1 ng/mL.Fasting conditions significantly increased anthocyanin bioavailability by more than sevenfold.Interestingly, various anthocyanins displayed distinct levels of bioavailability, whereby glycosides and glycosyl groups influenced absorption rates.Notably, there existed a significant correlation between the relative absorption of each anthocyanin and its molecular interactions with GLUT2 and SGLT1.\n\nToday, individuals are aware of the benefits of fruits and vegetables in general, leading to systematic research on their ideal intake and associated health effects.Earling et al. [65] investigated the dosage of anthocyanins in acai fruit pulp, a rich source of anthocyanins, and 19 dietary supplements derived from it (including 6 capsules, 9 powders, and 4 concentrates) and found substantial variations in the total anthocyanin content among different products.For instance, capsule 6 (C 6 ) contained a mean total anthocyanin content of 0.06 Ke mg/g, while capsule 1 (C 1 ) had a content of 19.24 Ke mg/g.Statistically significant discrepancies in total anthocyanin distribution among various products were observed.Freeze-dried açai products such as capsules C 1 , and powders P 3 and P 7 exhibited the highest anthocyanin levels, while liquid supplements and frozen fruit pulp had the lowest concentrations.The quality of anthocyanin supplements available on the market can evidently vary significantly, as it is influenced by the employed production methods.\n\n\nMetabolism of Anthocyanins\n\nAfter being digested and entering the bloodstream, anthocyanins undergo substantial metabolism (Figure 4).Ferrars et al. [66] labeled anthocyanins and orally administered 6,8,10,3 ,5 -13C5-C3G to participants.The researchers identified 34 metabolites, with 17 detected in the circulation, 31 in the urine, and 28 in the feces.These findings suggest that ingested anthocyanins undergo significant redistribution, transformation, or degradation within the body.Bile, which acts as a carrier for various substances, is produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder.During food consumption, bile is released into the small intestine and can be reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation.After absorption into the bloodstream, anthocyanins are conveyed through the portal vein to the liver and subsequently distributed to hepatocytes.After undergoing hepatic metabolism, anthocyanins re-enter the intestinal system via the bile.Once in the intestine, the intestinal microbiota transforms some anthocyanins into low-molecular catabolic metabolites, like phenolic acids and other phenolics.These metabolites may be reabsorbed or excreted through feces.After absorption, anthocyanins and their catabolic products undergo further metabolism.Specifically, these compounds are catalyzed by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGTS), sulfate-transferase (SULTS), and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) in the intestinal wall to form glucuronidation, sulfation, and methylation, respectively [67].It should be noted that bile acids can circulate in the enterohepatic circulation multiple times, although the number of cycles for anthocyanins remains unknown [68].Kalt et al. [69] examined anthocyanin metabolites in urine and identified over 200 such metabolites.These compounds, which are mainly glycosidic elements, show a wide range of polarity and are excreted in the urine, where they coexist with phospholipids rich in bile.Remarkably, high levels of anthocyanin metabolites persisted in urine even after five days without anthocyanin intake.Extensive enterohepatic circulation results in prolonged anthocyanin residence and considerable anthocyanin II binding.Anthocyanins are present in almost all tissues, including brain tissue where Phase II metabolites of anthocyanins have been identified [70].Natural anthocyanins, however, are solely present in gastric tissues within the digestive system.Other organs, such as the jejunum, liver, and kidneys, contain both natural and modified anthocyanins, with varying proportions of anthocyanin derivatives in different organs.The liver exhibits the highest proportion of methylated forms, while glycosidic forms predominate in the jejunum and plasma [10].\n\nThe concentration and abundance of anthocyanins and their metabolites are critical factors influencing their potential physiological effects, as the bloodstream can transport anthocyanins to target sites where they may exert their effects [71].The specific physiological effects of individual anthocyanin species vary based on their uptake, relative bioavailability, and distribution throughout the body.\n\nFor instance, anthocyanins distributed in the gut can interact with intestinal flora, altering the protective effects of anthocyanins against obesity and associated insulin resistance.Esposito et al. [72] investigated the gastrointestinal distribution of blackcurrant anthocyanins and their phenolic acid metabolites in obese mice consuming a diet supplemented with blackcurrant extract.It was observed that intact intestinal microbiota was essential for the reduction of weight gain and improvement of glucose metabolism in mice fed a low-fat or high-fat diet with blackcurrant extract.Administration of antibiotics substantially increased fecal anthocyanin content, indicating heightened sensitivity to intestinal microbial degradation.Moreover, gallic acid levels were found to be significantly higher than protocatechuic acid in the jejunum of both normal and antibiotic-treated animals, suggesting that this effect may be independent of intestinal microbiota status.Furthermore, these observations collectively emphasize the influence of gut microbiota and phloretin glycoside fraction in modifying the protective effects of anthocyanins against obesity and insulin resistance.\n\nresidence and considerable anthocyanin II binding.Anthocyanins are present in almost all tissues, including brain tissue where Phase II metabolites of anthocyanins have been identified [70].Natural anthocyanins, however, are solely present in gastric tissues within the digestive system.Other organs, such as the jejunum, liver, and kidneys, contain both natural and modified anthocyanins, with varying proportions of anthocyanin derivatives in different organs.The liver exhibits the highest proportion of methylated forms, while glycosidic forms predominate in the jejunum and plasma [10].The concentration and abundance of anthocyanins and their metabolites are critical factors influencing their potential physiological effects, as the bloodstream can transport anthocyanins to target sites where they may exert their effects [71].The specific physiological effects of individual anthocyanin species vary based on their uptake, relative bioavailability, and distribution throughout the body.\n\nFor instance, anthocyanins distributed in the gut can interact with intestinal flora, altering the protective effects of anthocyanins against obesity and associated insulin resistance.Esposito et al.

[75] investigated the effect of the fermentation process on anthocyanin bioavailability in red kale.In a randomized crossover study, 13 participants consumed fresh and fermented red kale.Blood and urine samples collected before and after consumption revealed that fresh red kale anthocyanins exhibited over 10% higher bioavailability compared to their fermented counterparts.This study underscored the impact of food processing on anthocyanin bioavailability.\n\nIt is well-established that anthocyanins undergo transformation by various enzymes in the digestive system, significantly affecting their bioavailability in the body.For instance, glucuronide structure transferase (UGT) exhibits variability in glucuronide binding for anthocyanins among individuals, thereby influencing individual anthocyanin bioavailability.Court et al. [76] analyzed data from human liver banks to explore hepatic UGT.It was found that the ranking of activity variation was UGT1A1 > 1A6 > 2B15 > 1A4 = 1A9 > 2B7, with coefficients of variation ranging from 92% to 45%.The variation in UGT activity was attributed to donor age, sex, enzyme inducers, and genetic polymorphisms.Importantly, enzyme inducers such as co-administered drugs, smoking, and alcohol could increase UGT levels in the liver.\n\nThe role of gut microbes is integral to the study of anthocyanin bioavailability, as they represent one of the most influential factors in anthocyanin absorption.These microorganisms use anthocyanin metabolism to produce new anthocyanin metabolites that can be taken up by the intestinal epithelium, leading to physiological regulation.Therefore, the bioavailability of anthocyanins is largely dependent on the capabilities of the intestinal microbiota for biotransformation.Given the interindividual variability in intestinal microbiota, differences in anthocyanin responses are to be anticipated among individuals.Chen et al. [77] explored anthocyanin biotransformation properties using five intestinal probiotics.These probiotics, namely Lactobacillus acidophilus GIM 1.83, Lactobacillus bulgaricus GIM1.155,Bifidobacterium animalis GIM1.169,Lactobacillus plantarum GIM1.35, and Streptococcus thermophiles GIM1.321, were incubated with mulberry anthocyanins under anaerobic conditions at 37 • C. The study revealed that all strains exhibited some degree of anthocyanin conversion, with Streptococcus thermophilus GIM 1.321 and Lactobacillus plantarum GIM1.35, boasting stronger β-glucosidase production capacities, achieving degradation rates of 46.17% and 43.62%, respectively.Anaerobic processing primarily transformed mulberry anthocyanins into chlorogenic acid, cryptophyllic acid, caffeic acid, and ferulic acid.This experiment confirmed the degradation of various types of mulberry anthocyanins and identified the resulting metabolites from anthocyanin conversion.It highlights the significant impact of microorganisms on anthocyanin bioavailability.\n\n\nPhysiological Functions of Anthocyanins\n\n\nAntioxidant Effect of Anthocyanins\n\nAnthocyanins, as a class of biologically active compounds, exert significant influence on human health, primarily attributed to their potent antioxidant capabilities.The salient feature among their myriad effects is their capacity to neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) directly, while also eliciting indirect pathways to stimulate the synthesis or biological activity of crucial antioxidant enzymes, including catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase.Additionally, anthocyanins are capable of inhibiting enzymes responsible for the generation of ROS, such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, while also regulating the slight uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration to prevent ROS production [2].The therapeutic effectiveness of anthocyanins is heavily dependent on their ability to scavenge ROS and their regulatory role in the cellular antioxidant system.\n\nFree radicals, including ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), are essential to normal bodily function, with redox reactions maintaining their equilibrium.However, oxidative stress can occur when this balance is disrupted, leading to an imbalance that plays a vital role in the development and progression of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and aging [78].Anthocyanins often act as donors of hydrogen ions or employ single-electron transfer mechanisms to thwart oxidation, thereby mitigating oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals and inhibiting their production [79].As a result, the structural features of anthocyanins greatly affect their antioxidant capacity.\n\nThe antioxidant capacity of anthocyanins is tied to the arrangement of their rings, which determines proton transfer ease.The number and positioning of free hydroxyl groups on the pyranone ring also affect their antioxidant action [80].Research revealed that flecainide exhibits the highest antioxidant activity among six anthocyanins due to the presence of three hydroxyl groups on its B ring [81].Furthermore, other structural elements incorporated in the anthocyanin framework significantly enhance their antioxidant abilities, with glycosylated B-ring structures being particularly noteworthy.In addition, adjacent hydroxylation and methoxylation further intensify the antioxidant activity.\n\nPhysical factors have a significant impact on anthocyanins' antioxidant properties.Different extraction techniques applied to the same source can produce anthocyanins with varying activities due to variations in operating procedures and conditions.It was found that solvent extraction achieved the highest average antioxidant inhibition rate at 90%, followed by enzyme extraction at 80%, and ultrasonic extraction at a mere 60%.This underscores the potency of solvent extraction in maximizing the antioxidant potential of blueberry anthocyanins [82].Since anthocyanins rely on single electron transfer and hydrogen ion transfer mechanisms for their antioxidant effects, temperature, and pH are crucial factors that influence their effectiveness.Shi et al. [83] found that anthocyanins exhibited enhanced free radical scavenging ability as the temperature increased within the pH range of 1-8.\n\n\nImmunomodulation by Anthocyanins\n\nTwo important aspects supporting the immunoregulatory function of anthocyanins revolve around their capacity to regulate oxidative stress and inflammatory responses.The sustained consumption of foods rich in anthocyanin yields a potent effect that does not solely rely on the chemical antioxidant properties of consumed anthocyanins; rather, this health-promoting process often corresponds to the organism's adaptation to anthocyanins [84].\n\nInflammation is a crucial protective mechanism that the body uses to combat external agents like bacteria, aiding in the elimination of harmful stimuli and the initiation of the healing process.However, inflammatory responses can facilitate host ailments, including hay fever, glomerulonephritis, atherosclerosis, and gastroenteritis, and may also promote cancer development under conditions of aberrant immune function.Organisms meticulously regulate inflammation by overseeing the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and mediators.Disease progression often commences with the engagement of inflammatory factors (e.g., histamine, leukotrienes, PGE2, bradykinin), characterized by substantial vascular effects such as heightened permeability, vasodilation, sluggish blood flow, ultimately culminating in leukocyte aggregation and extravasation into the vasculature.This process is accompanied by the secretion of cytokines like TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β by granulocytes, along with the promotion of other inflammatory mediators and macrophage recruitment to the site of inflammation [85].\n\nAnthocyanins, a class of compounds with immunomodulatory effects, have a significant role in regulating protein expression in the body through various cellular mechanisms that reduce oxidative damage and inhibit inflammatory responses in cells.These mechanisms encompass the upregulation of cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), induction of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase through nuclear oxidation reducers/antioxidant response elements (Nrf2/ARE), and the downregulation of nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancers in activated B cells [86].The beneficial effects of consuming anthocyanin-rich foods as part of a healthy lifestyle seem to depend on the activation of specific cellular pathways that enable the development of a flexible cellular microenvironment with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.This microenvironment can effectively respond to immune activities triggered by diverse physiological (e.g., exercise) or pathophysiological events [87].André et al. [88] discovered that apple cultivars with a high concentration of proanthocyanidins significantly inhibited NF-κB, while the fraction with high levels of triterpenes considerably decreased the promoter activity of the TNF-α gene.This research offers fresh insights into leveraging apple genetic diversity to combat inflammation, particularly in the context of diseases associated with acute or chronic inflammation, such as neurodegenerative disorders linked to tumor necrosis factor [89].Furthermore, anthocyanins not only reduce inflammatory responses but also modulate gut microbiota, indicating a broader impact on health.Espley et al. [90] conducted experiments involving male mice, comparing genetically modified apples with elevated flavonoid content to non-genetically modified apples with standard flavonoid levels.The research investigated the effects of dietary flavonoids on both inflammatory responses and gut microbiology in mice.The results indicated that mice on a flavonoid-rich diet exhibited a reduction exceeding twofold (p < 0.05) in transcript levels of inflammation-related genes, including interleukin-2 receptor (Il2rb), chemokine receptor 2 (Ccr2), chemokine ligand 10 (Cxcl10), and chemokine receptor 10 (Ccr10).Additionally, these mice showed a 6% increase in total bacterial count compared to the control group.\n\nStudies have elucidated the association between the chemical structure of anthocyanins and the molecular pathways governing their anti-inflammatory responses.Specifically, their effectiveness as anti-inflammatory agents depends on their glycosyl and glycoside structures, as well as patterns of hydroxylation and methylation.Triebel et al. [91] probed the effects of lingonberry extract (BE) and anthocyanins on pro-inflammatory genes in human colonic epithelial cells stimulated with IFN-γ/IL-1β/TNF-α.It was found that BE and individual anthocyanins significantly suppressed the expression and secretion of proinflammatory mediators, such as TNF-α, IP-10, I-TAC, sICAM-1, and GRO-α, in stimulated cells.Interestingly, anthocyanins showed greater stability, which probably enhanced the effectiveness of BE.\n\n\nCancer Prevention\n\nThe prevailing theory of cancer suggests that it results from somatic cells multiplying uncontrollably due to the gradual accumulation of random mutations in crucial genes regulating cell differentiation and growth [92].The onset of these mutations is initiated by the assault of free radicals on DNA.When DNA repair mechanisms falter, mutations gradually accumulate.Subsequently, when the oncogenes within these cells are silenced, cancer cells commence their development.Complementing this theory is the concept of \"immunosurveillance,\" which proposes that successful evasion of the immune system by accumulated mutated cells leads to uncontrolled tumor growth.One significant factor contributing to the increased incidence of cancer among immunosuppressed and immunodeficient individuals is the absence of immunosurveillance.\n\nThe antioxidant properties of anthocyanins can decrease the occurrence of mutations by reducing the generation of free radicals.Cristóbal et al. [93] reported that the effects of crude extracts of Carafate fruit and anthocyanin-rich extracts on human gastric cancer cell lines (agc) and gallbladder cancer cell lines (g415) were explored in vitro.These extracts exhibited substantial antioxidant activity, with Carafate berry extracts rich in anthocyanins demonstrating noteworthy potential.The anthocyanin-rich extracts demonstrated a higher effectiveness in inhibiting both the activity and migration of gastric cancer and gallbladder cancer cell lines when compared to the crude extract.\n\nMarty et al. [94] proposed that genetic factors play a crucial role in regulating tumorigenesis by influencing the immune system's ability to recognize specific common transformations.This suggests that individual differences in immune system expression may be associated with cancer susceptibility.In contrast, anthocyanins and their metabolites can provide protection against esophageal cancer through the consumption of anthocyanin-rich fruits.These compounds inhibit cell proliferation, dampen inflammation, induce apoptosis, promote cell differentiation, and enhance cell adhesion.Moreover, they restrict the production and progression of cancer by regulating several genes expressed through different signaling pathways, thus protecting cellular functions.Daniel et al. [95] investigated the role of protocatechuic acid (PCA), the principal microbial metabolite of black raspberry (BRB) anthocyanins, in preventing NMBA-induced esophageal cancer in rats.The results indicated that BRBs, their constituent anthocyanins, and PCA effectively inhibited esophageal tumor formation through their suppressive effects on inflammationrelated genes.Elisabeth et al. [96] found that a diet enriched with 10% anthocyanins from lingonberry extract had anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive effects on cancer by reducing colon inflammation.\n\nHigh-risk behaviors and environmental factors play a vital role in cancer development.Factors associated with the etiology of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, including smoking, alcohol consumption, dietary habits, and human papillomavirus infection, can markedly increase the risk of cancer development.Conversely, a healthy diet has been found to considerably lower the incidence of esophageal cancer [97].\n\nMoreover, anthocyanins can inhibit cancer progression by modulating the expression of specific genes involved in cancer cell spread.Li et al. [98] examined the anti-metastatic properties of anthocyanins from black rice on ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells.The findings revealed that these anthocyanins reduced tumor growth, inhibited lung metastasis, and decreased the activity of the metastasis-promoting factor urokinase-type fibrinolytic plasminogen activator (u-PA).The concentration-dependent effect of anthocyanins inhibited the migration, adhesion, motility, and invasive ability of breast cancer cells.\n\n\nAnthocyanins Regulate the Cardiovascular System\n\nDiseases that impact the cardiovascular system, such as coronary artery disease, hypertensive heart disease, heart failure, and cerebral thrombosis, are significant public health concerns.The development of cardiovascular system diseases is chiefly attributed to detrimental lifestyle habits, including but not limited to smoking, alcohol misuse, sedentary behavior, and unhealthy dietary patterns.Multiple pathological mechanisms contribute to the progression of cardiovascular system diseases, with risk factors such as hyperlipidemia, obesity, hypertension, atherosclerosis, oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and hyperglycemia intricately linked to these maladies [99].While pharmaceutical interventions have made progress in extending disease progression and improving patient quality of life, they often come with significant adverse effects, including gastrointestinal complications, myocardial degeneration, and arrhythmias [100,101].Conversely, mounting evidence underscores the myriad biological activities inherent in natural foods rich in polyphenols, with a paramount focus on their antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties as pivotal agents in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.Epidemiological investigations probing the relationship between dietary habits and cardiovascular ailments have consistently demonstrated that increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, grains, and nuts correlates with a diminished risk of cardiovascular disease [102].\n\nAnthocyanins, which are naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds present in a variety of foods, have a significant impact on lowering oxidative stress and alleviating inflammatory reactions.They also possess an exceptional ability to neutralize risk factors linked to cardiovascular disease, including the ones stemming from atmospheric pollutants.At the genetic level, anthocyanins can significantly ameliorate risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases by regulating the expression of inflammatory genes and reducing blood glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein levels.Anahita et al. [103] discovered a noteworthy decrease in fasting glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, and LDL levels in the group who followed a diet enriched with berry-based anthocyanins, in comparison to the control group.Importantly, PPAR-γ gene expression was positively correlated with lipid and glucose metabolism while negatively correlated with FBG, cholesterol, TG, and LDL levels.Furthermore, anthocyanins reduced serum HS-CRP levels and downregulated NF-κB-dependent genes, including TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1a, PCAM-1, and cox-2, in both metastatic and control subjects.These findings underscore the potential of berry supplementation in improving metabolic syndrome and associated cardiovascular risk factors, largely attributed to the inhibition of NF-κB-dependent gene expression and enhancement of PPAR-γ.\n\nA diet rich in fruits and vegetables holds promise for improving heart health by reducing oxidative stress and modulating signaling pathways.Xu et al. [104] examined the potential of anthocyanins to prevent accelerated aging of mouse hearts.The study involved administering D-galactose to mice for accelerated aging, followed by anthocyanin intervention at 20 and 40 mg/kg.The evaluation of heart function and structure after 8 weeks revealed that anthocyanins delayed the reduction of cardiac index and myocardial tissue damage.Furthermore, they maintained the stability of redox systems, including GSH-Px, T-SOD, and MDA, both in serum and myocardial tissue.In the DNA damage signaling pathway, anthocyanins downregulated the expression levels of receptors such as ATM and ATR, along with Chk1 and Chk2 effectors.These findings underscore the potential of anthocyanins as nutraceuticals to delay age-related deterioration of cardiac structure and function by inhibiting DNA damage.\n\nAtmospheric pollutants are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease.Inhaling particulate pollutants, such as PM2.5, triggers pulmonary inflammatory and pro-oxidant pathways that result in a systemic inflammatory response.This compromises vascular function and accelerates atherosclerosis.Wang et al. [105] investigated the protective effects of blueberry anthocyanin extracts against PM2.5-induced cardiac injury.Rats exposed to PM2.5 and treated with three different doses (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 g/kg) of blueberry anthocyanin extract exhibited improved cardiac function, reduced cytokine levels, and enhanced levels of interleukin-10, cardiac tissue superoxide dismutase activity, and Bcl-2 protein expression.Additionally, levels of interleukin-6, malondialdehyde, endothelin-1, and angiotensin II were decreased, while Bax protein expression was reduced.This study proposes that a particular amount of blueberry anthocyanin extract has the potential to protect the cardiovascular system against the harmful effects of PM2.5.\n\nMoreover, the salutary effects of anthocyanins extend beyond protection against injury.In healthy individuals, anthocyanins exert a protective influence on blood vessels, thereby enhancing vascular health and preserving dynamic homeostasis.Brett et al. [106] posited that blueberry anthocyanins possess substantial evidence of vascular protective effects.This evidence encompasses epidemiological, animal experimental, and human studies, all converging to demonstrate that blueberry anthocyanins enhance vascular health by targeting various aspects of the cardiovascular system.This includes reducing oxidative stress, modulating signaling pathways, and ameliorating dyslipidemia, resulting in potential physiological benefits for cardiovascular health.\n\n\nEncapsulation of Anthocyanins\n\nAnthocyanins are highly sensitive to environmental factors, such as light, heat, and oxygen, which can lead to their degradation and loss of bioactivity [107].To preserve and effectively deliver anthocyanins for various applications, numerous encapsulation techniques and delivery systems have been explored.This section delves into the diverse strategies for anthocyanin encapsulation, several delivery vehicles are summarized in Table 2. Improve the stability of anthocyanins and enhances the oral bioavailability of anthocyanins [115] Emulsions are colloidal systems consisting of two immiscible phases, typically oil and water, stabilized by an emulsifying agent [116].They have been widely employed to encapsulate anthocyanins, protecting them from degradation.Recently, microemulsion and nanoemulsion gained more and more attention.They are usually produced under high-speed shear, high-pressure homogenization, dynamic high-pressure microjets, and ultrasonication, and are often stabilized by surfactants and cosurfactants [109].They have smaller particle sizes and are more stable, as well as the higher encapsulation efficiency of anthocyanins.Rabelo et al. [110] successfully formulated a food-grade water-in-oil (W/O) nanoemulsion to encapsulate anthocyanins, and it can remain relatively stable, with no phase separation after 30 days of storage; the retention rate (94.6%) of anthocyanins in nanoemulsions was higher than that (47.9%) of free anthocyanins.Nazareth et al. [109] found that the degradation kinetics of anthocyanins in microemulsion/nanoemulsion followed first-order reaction rates, and the half-life of anthocyanin in nanoemulsion (40 days) was longer than that of microemulsion (25 days) and free anthocyanin (6 days).It indicated that nanoemulsion might have better storage stability and protection effects than microemulsion.In general, the hydrophilic anthocyanins are accommodated in the aqueous phase.To gain the higher encapsulation efficiency and better protection effect stable of anthocyanins, the water-in-oil-in-water (W 1 /O/W 2 ) double emulsions were developed, which were made up of water-in-oil (W 1 /O) emulsions distributed in the outer aqueous phase (W 2 ) as droplets [111].Ozcan et al. [112] prepared a W/O/W emulsion with a high encapsulation efficiency of anthocyanins (87.89%) and found it also can improve the bioaccessibility of anthocyanins.Some studies have reported that anthocyanins in the emulsions had a protective effect against lipid oxidation [108], and the anthocyanin-loaded W/O/W emulsions exhibited good performance as a potential ink for food 3D printing.Recently, a new type of emulsion has been studied, namely Pickering emulsion, it avoids the use of surfactants, inhibits droplet coalescence, and possesses super stability [113].Ju et al. [113] used the soy protein-anthocyanin complex nanoparticles as an interfacial stabilizer to produce a Pickering emulsion, and indicated that the Pickering emulsion exhibits unique characteristics, including extraordinary emulsion stability, improved oxidative stability, and resistance to in vitro digestion.Emulsions containing anthocyanins have shown good promise in various food and pharmaceutical applications.\n\nNanoparticles, including polymeric nanoparticles and lipid nanoparticles, have gained attention as efficient carriers for anthocyanin delivery.Polymeric nanoparticles, often made from biocompatible materials like β-Lactoglobulin [114], alginate, and chitosan, provide a protective matrix for anthocyanin encapsulation.A previous study by He et al. [14] found that the loading of anthocyanins on chitosan nanoparticles can prevent anthocyanin degradation in gastrointestinal fluids and improve its stability in a beverage.The stability of the encapsulated anthocyanins was 84.5% after 35 days at 4 • C, which was higher than that (71.2%) of unencapsulated anthocyanins [14].Ge et al. [114] have found the composite nanoparticle composed of β-Lactoglobulin and chitosan derivatives was a good carrier for anthocyanins, it significantly improved the stability and bioavailability of anthocyanins in the simulated gastrointestinal tract.Lipid nanoparticles are composed of solid lipids and are usually used to encapsulate hydrophobic bioactive compounds.Some core-shell lipid nanoparticles were prepared by the dilution of water in oil (W/O) microemulsions containing a hydrophilic core in aqueous media.They can offer a stable environment for hydrophilic bioactive compounds, such as anthocyanins.Ravanfar et al. [115] prepared the solid lipid nanoparticles based on palmitic acid, span 85, and egg lecithin.These lipid nanoparticles have a high entrapment efficiency (89.2 ± 0.3%) and gain the advantage of controlled release and sustained delivery of anthocyanins.\n\nIn conclusion, anthocyanin encapsulation is a dynamic field that continues to evolve with the development of innovative delivery systems.These systems, including emulsions, microemulsions, nanoemulsions, biopolymer nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, and other vehicles, play a pivotal role in protecting anthocyanins from environmental stressors and enhancing their bioavailability.The choice of delivery system depends on the specific application and the physicochemical properties of the anthocyanin of interest.Further research in this area holds the potential to unlock new avenues for utilizing anthocyanins in various industries, ranging from food and nutrition to pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nAnthocyanins are a class of bioactive compounds abundant in nature that offer significant nutritional value due to their widespread availability, affordability, and high public acceptance.They exhibit diverse biological activities, including potent antioxidant properties, immunomodulatory effects, regulation of blood lipid profiles, and a critical role in cancer prevention.While extraction and production methods for anthocyanins have advanced, their poor physicochemical stability remains a challenge, requiring a strategic focus on preserving their biological potency.Intensive research into process-resistant anthocyanin-based formulations in food science is needed, such as nanotechnology, multicomponent synergistic effect, and colloidal delivery systems to improve their resilience and maximize their utility in food applications, with innovative approaches to maintaining anthocyanin functionality having the potential to stimulate market growth.The advancement of anthocyanin research through scientific investigation and technological intervention promises to unlock new opportunities for their application to improve human health and well-being.\n\nFigure 1 .\n1\nFigure 1.Schematic diagram of preparation and physiological function of anthocyanins.\n\n\nFigure 1 .\n1\nFigure 1.Schematic diagram of preparation and physiological function of anthocyanins.\n\n\nFoods\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 .\n2\nFigure 2.
