		Tackle the analytical part of data mining projects
	
                            <h2>Description</h2>
<p>Many modern digital applications increasingly rely on machine learning as a means to derive predictive strength from high-dimensional data sets. Compared to traditional statistics  the absence of a focus on scientific hypotheses  and the need for easily leveraging detailed signals in the data require a different set of models  tools  and analytical reflexes.</p>
<p>This course aims to bring participants to the level where they can independently tackle the analytical part of data mining projects. This means that the most common types of projects will be addressed - regression-type with continuous outcomes  classification with categorical outcomes  and clustering. For each of these  the practical use of a set of standard methods will be shown  like Random Forests  Gradient Boosting Machines  Support Vector Machines  k-Nearest-Neighbors  K-means ... Furthermore  throughout the course  concepts will be highlighted that are of concern in every statistical learning applications  like the curse of dimensionality  model capacity  overfitting and regularization  and practical strategies will be offered to deal with them  introducing techniques such as the Lasso and ridge regression  cross-validation  bagging and boosting. Instructions will also be given on a selection of specific techniques that are often of interest  such as modern visualization of high-dimensional data  model calibration  outlier detection using isolation forests  explanation of black-box models ... Finally  the last lecture will introduce the idea of deep learning as a powerful tool for data analysis  discussing when and how to practically use it  and when to shy away from it.</p>

<h2>Target audience</h2>
<p>This course targets professionals and investigators from all areas that are involved in predictive modeling based on large and/or high-dimensional databases.</p>
<h2>Fees</h2>
<p>The participation fee is 1470 EUR for participants from the private sector. Reduced prices apply to students and staff from non-profit  social profit  and government organizations. An exam fee of 35 EUR will be applied.</p>

For those working with AI on a daily basis, staying up to date with the newest techniques within various domains is a challenge. In this seminar series, academic experts will bring you up to speed with the hottest topics: Advanced GenAI, Knowledge Graphs, MLOps and AI@Edge. All seminars include a hands-on component.</p>|"
            <h4><strong>Advanced GenAI (17 April 2024  12.30-15.30h)</strong></h4>
<p>Dr. Thomas Winters</p>
<p>These
 days  we are surrounded by creative text and image generators like GPT 
and diffusion models that seem to be able to generate anything we want. 
But how do we ensure that these types of AI truly aid us in overcoming 
our unique challenges? This talk sheds light on several techniques for 
controlling such generative models. We look at several powerful prompt 
engineering techniques – the art of enhancing our communication with AI –
 and useful ways of connecting these generators to other systems. We 
dive into the world of autoregressive text generators  learn their inner
 mechanisms and which training phases they went through to get to the 
current state-of-the-art text generators. These insights help us 
understand why certain prompt engineering techniques (such as few-shot 
prompting  role-prompting and chain-of-thought prompting) are able to 
outperform simpler prompting methods. We also briefly look at several 
other techniques to overcome the limitations of such models  such as 
retrieval-augmented generation and function calling. Similarly  we 
uncover the workings of diffusion models and show several techniques to 
gain more control over the generated images. We show how even some of 
AI's classic hard problems  such as humour generation  become even more 
within reach thanks to these large language models and their prompt 
engineering techniques.</p>
<h4><strong>Knowledge Graphs (17 April 2024  16.00-19.00h)</strong></h4>
<p>Prof. Pieter Bonte and prof. Anastasia Dimou</p>
<p>Knowledge
 graphs have become the ultimate technology for unlocking the full 
potential of your data  illuminating the connections between entities  
attributes  and relationships with unparalleled clarity. Sharing &amp; 
exchanging data  harvesting insights  driving innovation  fostering 
integration  and revolutionizing data exploration  knowledge graphs pave
 the way for transformative discoveries and understanding.</p>
<p>In this seminar  the following topic will be tackled:</p>
<ul><li>Introduction to knowledge graphs</li><li>Semantic Web basics: RDF</li><li>From raw data to knowledge graphs with [R2]RML</li><li>Unlocking insights with querying through SPARQL</li></ul>
<h4><strong>MLOps (25 April 2024  12.30-15.30h)</strong></h4>
<p>Prof. Mathias Verbeke and drs. Lara Luys</p>
<p>One
 of the main challenges for industry today is to get machine learning 
models out of the proof-of-concept phase and into production. This is 
not an easy task since data in production is not static  due to which 
the model performance can degrade over time. Machine learning operations
 or MLOps is a paradigm that aims to address this problem. Being a 
contraction of Machine Learning and DevOps  MLOps focuses on developing 
and maintaining machine learning models in production. This includes 
training  evaluating as well as monitoring the model. In this seminar  
the MLOps pipeline and the underlying principles will be explained  
illustrated by means of a number of tools that can be used in the MLOps 
process.</p>
<h4><strong>AI@Edge (25 April 2024  16.00-19.00h)</strong></h4>
<p>Prof. Hans Hallez and drs. Gregory De Ruyter</p>
<p>Edge
 Computing has been proven to be an optimised way to delegate 
computation from the cloud towards the devices where the sensing takes 
place. Edge computing on embedded devices mostly limits itself towards 
compression  filtering or other basic analysis. Recent trends also show 
that devices near the edge of the sensor network are capable of machine 
learning algorithms. In this session  we will explore different 
techniques to bring machine learning towards the edge network and deploy
 these algorithms. First  we will give an overview of what embedded 
devices are  and how we can perform machine learning at these devices 
both in inference and in training. Second  we will give a hands-on 
demonstration as an inspiration of how machine learning at the edge can 
be implemented.</p>

            <p>As our reliance on technology continues to grow  the importance of 
digital ethics cannot be overstated. In today's world  organisations in 
every sector must be aware of the ethical implications of their actions 
in the digital realm. From the handling of personal data to the 
development of new technologies  the decisions we make have the 
potential to impact individuals  society  and the environment in 
profound ways. By participating in this course  you will gain the 
knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the complex ethical landscape
 of the digital world and make informed decisions that align with your 
organisation's values.</p>
<p>Our course will cover a range of important topics  including ethics 
frameworks and tools  regulation and legal issues  developing ethical 
technology  technology assessment  ethical dilemmas  and ethics in data 
and visualisation.</p>
        
            <p>This course is designed for professionals working in a wide range of organisations and industries. Whether you are employed in government  industry  academia  or the non-profit sector  you will benefit from the comprehensive coverage of key topics in Digital Ethics. The course is particularly relevant for those working in fields such as technology  interaction design  data analysis  policymaking  law  and research. However  anyone with an interest in Digital Ethics and the impact of technology on society will find value in this course.</p>
        
            <h4>Session 1: Ethics frameworks – Thursday 18 April 2024</h4>
<p>
During this session  we will explore the various frameworks that can be 
used to justify ethical decisions  including virtue ethics  consequence 
ethics  and duty ethics. The participants will learn how to 'think 
ethically'  and how these basic ethics frameworks can be applied to 
various scenarios in which digital technologies play a central role. We 
will also explore the concept of responsibility  including the different
 types of responsibility (moral  legal  causal or role responsibility) 
that can arise in the digital realm and discuss the responsibility gap. 
This session will provide attendees with a solid foundation in the basic
 principles of ethics and their relation to digital technology.</p>
<h4>Session 2: Building Ethical Foundations - Thursday 25 April 2024</h4>
<p>
This session aims to create a communal learning environment among the 
participants  both online and on-site. During this session  participants
 will introduce themselves  share their professional backgrounds and 
discuss their expectations for the course  providing invaluable insight 
for the instructors to tailor the subsequent sessions. Additionally  
participants will reflect on the ethical aspects of their jobs  
exploring potential ethical dilemmas within their specific work contexts
 such as government  industry  academia  or non-profit sectors. This 
early engagement is designed to foster a deeper understanding and 
awareness of the ethical issues to be explored throughout the course  
setting the stage for a more insightful reflection during the closing 
session.</p>
<h4>Session 3: Tools and methods for ethical decision making - Thursday 2 May 2024</h4>
<p>
In this session we will introduce tools and methods that can be used to 
make ethical decisions in different contexts  such as in industry  
government  academia and research. Participants will learn about 
practical frameworks and tools such as the guidance ethics approach  the
 AI Blindspots and the Data Ethics Decision Aid. This session will 
provide attendees with the basic tools and methods in the practice of 
ethical decision-making in the digital realm.</p>
<h4>Session 4: Technology assessment in practice – Thursday 16 May 2024</h4>
<p>
This session will provide insight into the impact and effects of 
technology  and will introduce tools and methods for assessing the risks
 of innovation and averting undesirable consequences of new 
technologies. The session will look into the challenges of achieving 
(positive or negative) impacts with technology due to the interplay of 
technology  society  organisations and individuals. A dedicated focus 
will be on the impact of AI technologies in a government context as well
 as on evaluating the results of social corporate responsibility actions
 in the context of a company. This session will provide attendees with 
practical examples of how to effectively assess the risks and potential 
consequences of technology.</p>
<h4>Session 5: Designing ethical technology – Thursday 23 May 2024</h4>
<p>
In this session  we will explore different approaches to designing 
technology that takes into account the needs and values of human beings.
 We will explore humanity-centered design (including design thinking)  
inclusive design  value-centered design  and participatory design (or 
co-creation). We will then discuss how technologies are often designed 
in a way that threatens our digital well-being  and which strategies can
 be used to improve digital well-being. This session will provide 
attendees with the tools and knowledge they need to create ethical 
technology that is designed with people at its core.</p>
<h4>Session 6: Ethical topics and dilemmas – Thursday 30 May 2024</h4>
<p>This session will explore the application of behaviorist principles in 
digital technologies  particularly in the realm of surveillance. It will
 highlight how these technologies not only observe but actively 
influence and modify user behavior  raising important ethical questions 
about privacy  autonomy  and the power dynamics between users and 
technology providers. The session will emphasize the need for ethical 
guidelines to address the challenges posed by digital surveillance. This
 session further examines the various functions fairness and equality 
hold in the AI governance debate. Drawing from political philosophical 
theories of justice and practical use-cases  a relational perspective on
 AI is developed to understand better the social and technical dynamics 
that give rise to digital injustice. This session will provide attendees
 with an understanding of the ethical challenges that can arise in the 
digital world  and the tools and frameworks that can be used to address 
them.</p>
<h4>Session 7: Legal and policy issues – Thursday 6 June 2024</h4>
<p>
This session will explore a number of legal issues that arise in the 
digital realm. This session will first provide attendees with an 
understanding of appropriate legal frameworks related to the free flow 
of information  (personal) data protection  and the principles  rights 
and obligations of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 
This session will also provide a comprehensive review of the impact AI 
may have on individual and collective human rights across various 
sectors. The participants will learn about the technical legal 
instruments at their disposal to combat AI discrimination  including 
legal tools related to direct and indirect discrimination  as well as 
discrimination by association. Moreover  participants will be invited to
 critically reflect on the resilience of ethics in the context of AI. 
This approach to AI will consider high-level legal instruments within 
the European Union  such as the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights  the 
proposed AI Act  and the set of equality directives. A comparative law 
approach will also be mobilized to provide a better understanding of 
addressing AI challenges with traditional legal instruments.</p>
<h4>Session 8: Ethics in data and visualisation – Thursday 13 June 2024</h4>
<p>
In this session  we will discuss the ethical aspects of handling and 
visualising of data. We will start by examining how data are 
'constructed' and therefore are inherently 'biased'  rather than 
representing an objective truth. We cross over to understand the value 
of visualising data  acknowledging its potential risk to yet further 
objectify this constructed  situated nature of data. We then dive into 
how some data visualisations can be (unintentionally) perceived as 
unethical  whether through potentially misleading design choices  the 
use of dubious data  the omission of uncertainties  or the disregard of 
cognitive biases. This session aims to provide practical skills and 
reflective insights for handling and visualising data in ways that are 
more transparent  equitable and responsible.</p>
<h4>Session 9: Closing and reflection – Thursday 20 June 2024</h4>
<p>The seventh and final session will be a closing session focused on 
reflection. In this session  participants will have the opportunity to 
reflect on how the topics covered in the previous sessions apply to 
their own professional situations. This session will provide a space for
 attendees to share their thoughts  insights  and experiences  and to 
discuss how they plan to incorporate the knowledge and skills they have 
gained into their work. This will be a valuable opportunity for 
participants to consolidate their learning and to develop a personal 
plan for applying the principles of Digital Ethics in their professional
 lives.</p>

In this programme, we will explore the full spectrum of cybersecurity, from prevention to response, while gaining both immediate, hands-on skills and a foresight for the future of cybersecurity. This programme brings together academic researchers and industrial experts, and thus provides a blend of lectures and use cases and practical testimonials.</p>|"
            <p>Many companies rely on a Security Information and Event Management system (SIEM) to consolidate data from various applications and equipment  allowing them to maintain an overview of their security landscape. To investigate alerts generated by their SIEM system more thoroughly  they turn to a Network Protocol Analyzer (NPA). An NPA captures  analyzes  and visualizes network traffic and can have a broad range of applications.However  the procedures and configurations of NPAs vary according to the specific issue at hand (cybersecurity  troubleshooting  etc.)  which often leads to incorrect or inefficient usage in practice. During this workshop  we will build the knowledge and skills necessary to use Network Protocol Analyzers correctly and efficiently  particularly in the context of cybersecurity threats. We will work with real-life scenarios and gain practical insights into the underlying workings of NPAs. The NPA that we will delve deeper into during the workshop is the open-source NPA  Wireshark.</p>

            <p>Robots are becoming an integral part of our economy  society and planet  assisting us in various tasks. However  the rapid growth in robotics usage has also given rise to relevant concerns regarding sustainability. At present  urgent issues such as rare-earth material usage  e-waste  energy efficiency and ethical concerns hinders the sustainable development of robotics. As we increasingly rely on robotics  it becomes increasingly critical and urgent to ensure that these technological advancements are sustainable and eco-friendly. Since robotics is the integration of many technologies  we will discuss in this Forum sustainable robotics technologies ranging from material science  material processing and metal  electronics with sensors and processing  actuators  energy  power and batteries and control and artificial intelligence.</p>

		Introduction to the theory and application of structural equation modeling and handling missing data  nonnormal data  categorical data  etc.
	
                            <p>Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a general statistical modeling technique to study the relationships among observed and latent variables. It spans a wide range of multivariate methods including path analysis  mediation analysis  confirmatory factor analysis  growth curve modeling  and many more. Many applications of SEM can be found in the social  economic  behavioral and health sciences  but the technology is increasingly used in disciplines like biology  neuroscience and operation research. SEM is often used to test theories or hypotheses that can be represented by a path diagram. In a path diagram  observed variables are depicted by boxes  while latent variables (hypothetical constructs measured by multiple indicators) are depicted by circles. Hypothesized (possibly causal) effects among these variables are represented by single-headed arrows. If you had ever found yourself drawing a path diagram in order to get a better overview of the complex interrelations among some key variables in your data  this course is for you.<br></p>
<p>The first day of the course provides an introduction to the theory and application of structural equation modeling  and illustrates how to use the open-source R package `lavaan’ (see <a href=""https://lavaan.org"" tabindex=""-1"">https://lavaan.org</a>) to conduct an SEM analysis. On the second day  we discuss several special topics that are often needed by applied users (handling missing data  nonnormal data  categorical data  longitudinal data  multilevel data  etc.). With the exception of a short practical session at the end of the first day  the two days are mostly lectures  to maximize the amount of information that we can teach. However  do-it-yourself practicals (with written feedback and solutions) will be made available and illustrate all the topics that are covered in this course.</p>
<h2>Target audience</h2>
<p>This course targets everyone with an interest in testing theories or models that involve relationships between both observed and latent variables. The audience for this course can include both novices with little or no previous experience with SEM  as well as existing users who wish to refresh or update their theoretical and practical understanding of structural equation modeling.</p>
<h2>Fees</h2>
<p>The participation fee is 750 EUR for participants from the private sector. Reduced prices apply to students and staff from non-profit  social profit  and government organizations. An exam fee of 35 EUR will be applied.</p>
<ul><li>Industry  private sector  profession*: <strong>€ 750</strong></li><li>Non profit  government  higher education staff: <strong>€ 565</strong></li><li>(Doctoral) students  unemployed: <strong>€ 340</strong></li></ul>
<p>*If two or more employees from the same company enrol simultaneously for this course a reduction of 20% on the course fee is taken into account starting from the second enrolment.</p>

You will be able to build basic applications using IDP, and you will be able to identify potential use cases for this technology.</p>|"
            <p>In their day-to-day operations  companies typically make many small but important decisions  such as: </p>
<ul><li>which employee should handle an incoming request</li><li>which service should be recommended to a specific customer</li><li>how should a specific product be configured to meet a customer's requirement </li><li>whether a specific customer is entitled to a discount  etc. </li></ul>
<p>Decision
 support systems can help employees make these decisions faster  more 
reliably and more consistently  reducing costs and increasing confidence
 in the process. To develop such systems  black-box AI methods (such as 
deep learning) are not well-suited  because they lack the required 
transparency and explainability. A more promising approach are 
knowledge-based AI systems  which derive their 'intelligence' not from 
data  but from logical models of rules  regulations and expert 
knowledge.</p>
<p>In this workshop  you will get to know the 
state-of-the-art IDP knowledge-base system  developed at KU Leuven. It 
is currently being used by companies in the manufacturing (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpPe0GRjifE"" tabindex=""-1"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpPe0GRjifE</a>)  financial (<a href=""https://youtu.be/Zzsy4MtdWBE)"" tabindex=""-1"">https://youtu.be/Zzsy4MtdWBE)</a>
 and legal sectors to provide various decision support  both to their 
customers and in-house. This system is based on methods and techniques 
that were developed for declarative programming systems such as Prolog  
but it offers a number of important innovations: (1) instead of focusing
 only on querying  the IDP system provides a wide range of different 
functionalities that can be used to implement rich interactive 
interfaces that support users in different work-flows  (2) instead of 
relying on programmers  the system allows its end users to maintain the 
underlying knowledge base  which means that we can cut out the ""middle 
man"" of IT staff and allow the business experts themselves to update the
 system  thereby not only reducing cost and turn-around time but also 
putting the ownership of the decision knowledge in the right hands.</p>
<p><strong>The
 workshop starts with a brief introduction to Knowledge-based AI and 
presents existing applications in the financial and manufacturing 
sectors. We then proceed with a hands-on tutorial  using a freely 
available web interface that participants access from their own laptops.</strong></p>

            <p>In 2021  KU Leuven organised the first edition of the Summer School 
on the Law  Ethics and Policy of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Given the
 programme's overwhelming success  three editions have taken place thus 
far. The fourth edition will take place from 1 to 10 July 2024.</p>
<p>The Summer School aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the 
various legal  ethical and policy-related issues around AI and 
algorithm-driven processes more broadly. As these technologies have a 
growing impact on all domains of our lives  it becomes increasingly 
important to map  understand and assess the challenges and opportunities
 they raise. This requires an interdisciplinary approach  which is why 
we are collaborating across faculties and departments to organise this 
Summer School. The programme's goal is to offer participants the latest 
insights on AI from various perspectives  and in particular the fields 
of law  ethics and policy. </p>
<p>The lectures are provided by renowned academics  policy-makers from 
EU and international institutions as well as practitioners  allowing 
participants to grasp not only the theoretical but also the practical 
implications of the use of AI in these fields. </p>
<p>The Summer School's intended audience concerns postgraduate students 
who already obtained a master's degree and junior/senior researchers 
from various disciplines  as well as policy analysts  lawyers and legal 
experts  civil servants  members of civil society organisations  AI 
practitioners  and other professionals with an interest in broadening 
their understanding of AI and its impact on society. </p>
<p>Participants receive a certificate of attendance with the equivalence
 of 3 ECTS credits. Those interested also have an opportunity to share 
their research with fellow participants through a research presentation 
session. </p>
<p>Thus far  the Summer School has taken place as a hybrid event  enabling participants to join both <em>on campus</em> and <em>online</em>. </p>
<p>Whether physically or virtually  we look forward to welcoming you to Leuven!</p>
        
            <h3>Course overview</h3>
<p>The Summer School covers a range of topics that will enable 
participants to better grasp the various legal  ethical and policy 
implications of the development and use of AI in society. All lectures 
are taught in English.</p>
<p>The schedule of the Summer School's 2023 edition can be found <a href=""https://www.law.kuleuven.be/ai-summer-school/documentation/schedules/draft-schedule-ai-summer-school-2023"" tabindex=""-1"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Most lectures focus on horizontal domains of interest  covering topics such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Philosophy of AI</li>
	<li>Ethics of AI</li>
	<li>AI and Data Protection Law</li>
	<li>AI and Competition Law</li>
	<li>AI and Intellectual Property Law</li>
	<li>AI and Consumer Protection</li>
	<li>AI and Liability Law</li>
	<li>AI and Labour Law</li>
	<li>AI and Fairnes</li>
	<li>The European Commission's proposals for an AI Regulation  the Digital Services Act &amp; the Digital Markets Act</li>
	<li>AI governance and the role of European &amp; International institutions</li>
</ul>
<p>Though Artificial Intelligence is a general purpose technology  many 
of its legal  ethical and policy-related implications are context- or 
sector-specific. Therefore  the programme also explores several vertical
 domains. These cover inter alia:</p>
<ul>
	<li>AI and Law Enforcement</li>
	<li>AI and Public Services</li>
	<li>AI and Warfare</li>
	<li>AI and Healthcare</li>
	<li>AI and Education</li>
	<li>AI and Legal Tech</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the course  participants who attended 90% of the 
classes and passed the exam receive a certificate of attendance with an 
equivalence of 3 ECTS credits. Those interested will also have the 
possibility to present their own research during a research presentation
 session. </p>
<h3>Intended Audience</h3>
<p>The Summer School’s intended audience concerns postgraduate students 
who already obtained a master's degree and PhD researchers from various 
disciplines  as well as more senior researchers  policy analysts  
lawyers and legal experts  civil servants  members of civil society 
organisations  AI practitioners  and other professionals with an 
interest in broadening their understanding of AI and its impact on 
society.</p>
<h3>Programme Format &amp; Location</h3>
<p>In the past  the Summer School was organised as a hybrid event  enabling participants to join either <em>on campus</em> or <em>online</em>. </p>
<p>The lectures take place at the KU Leuven Faculty of Law:</p>

            <p>The <em>Postgraduate Certificate: Artificial Intelligence in Business and Industry</em> aims
 to give engineers  computer scientists and other professionals the 
opportunity to specialise in the field of artificial intelligence. <br></p>
<p>The
 programme has been designed with a specific need in the job market in 
mind: many current employees in for example R&amp;D divisions of leading
 companies are highly skilled but did not receive specific training on 
AI in their formal education. Perhaps you  too  experience the need to 
bring your AI skills up to date and are looking for a qualitative AI 
course to do that. This postgraduate training allows professionals to 
acquire in one year a solid academic knowledge of artificial 
intelligence  as well as insight into the domains of image and language 
(computer vision/NLP) and business aspects of AI. </p>
<p>The postgraduate programme <em>Artificial Intelligence in Business and Industry</em> stands
 firmly on its own but also opens the door to more. Participants can 
choose to follow a follow-up track into the Advanced Master <em>AI in Business and Industry </em>(to
 be launched in September 2023)  where they gain access to the wider 
range of in-depth  broadening and  in particular  more applied modules. 
The courses offered in the postgraduate programme form an integral part 
of the Advanced Master <em>Artificial Intelligence in Business and Industry</em> 
 and participants who pass the courses in the postgraduate programme 
will be granted exemptions when following the rest of the master’s 
programme.</p>
        
            <p>The programme aims at different 
kinds of engineers (e.g. in Engineering Science  Engineering Technology 
 or Business Engineers who majored in data science or applied computer 
science). In addition  the programme is open to masters in mathematics 
and physics. In general  any participant with a master’s degree that 
offers sufficient background in mathematics  programming and technology 
will be admitted. If you do not have one of the aforementioned master 
diplomas  you can submit a file with your motivation and CV to the 
programme committee  who will assess your application. Note that Python 
proficiency (basic) is required. An optional 6-month subscription to 
Datacamp can be provided upon registration. </p>
<p>While recently 
graduated students are welcome  the programme also offers added value to
 professionals with field experience  wishing to re- or upskill 
themselves in the field of Artificial Intelligence in order to make the 
most of their career opportunities. The programme specifically caters to
 participants looking for a theoretical  academically grounded approach 
to AI. Given the advanced content of the courses  the profiles most 
suitable for this postgraduate are  for example  IT developers and 
functional analysts or R&amp;D staff  engineers  project leaders and 
managers.</p>
        
            <p>The programme starts with the theoretical AI foundations that are indispensable for professionals. Participants therefore get 3 academic courses that teach them the scientific basics of artificial intelligence. In addition  the door is opened to industrial applications and general business applications with the courses in the second semester.<br></p>
<h4>Fundamentals of AI</h4>
<p>In this course  you will acquire a deep knowledge and insight into foundational techniques from Artificial Intelligence  including search methods and their applications to games  the version spaces algorithm for machine learning  constraint processing techniques  strips planning and theorem proving for first-order predicate logic. You will be able to simulate each of the above techniques with pen and paper on small new examples and have insight into the relevance of these techniques for applications in domains such as manufacturing  health  education  logistics  manufacturing  and robotics. </p>
<h4>Machine Learning and Inductive Inference</h4>
<p>This
 course will familiarize you with the domain of machine learning  which 
concerns techniques to build software that can learn how to perform a 
certain task (or improve its performance on it) by studying examples of 
how it has been accomplished previously  and in a broader sense the 
discovery of knowledge from observations (inductive inference).<br>After following this course  you will</p>
<ul><li>have a basic understanding of the general principles of learning</li><li>have an overview of the existing techniques for machine learning and data mining</li><li>understand how these techniques work  and why they work</li><li>be able to implement programs that learn or exhibit adaptive behavior  using these techniques</li><li>be up-to-date with the current state of the art in machine learning research</li><li>be able to contribute to contemporary machine learning research<br> </li></ul>
<h4>Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning</h4>
<p>The
 course aims to introduce the basic techniques  methods and properties 
of ANN and to study their application to selected problems. The basic 
concepts will be introduced in the lectures. Advanced topics and recent 
research results will be touched upon occasionally. You will study and 
develop explicit neural network models for selected applications.</p>
<h4>Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing</h4>
<p>The
 course introduces natural language processing technologies and their 
applications in a variety of tasks  which include text mining  machine 
translation  question answering and dialogue modelling. It also 
introduces computer vision algorithms and their applications such as 
image classification  object detection  and image segmentation. Special 
attention goes to applications that require the joint processing of 
language and visual data  as this is a natural way to interact with 
machines. </p>
<p>The students will gain insights into suitable machine 
learning algorithms that ideally are trained with limited annotated 
examples or human feedback. They will learn how to build and critically 
assess an application making use of the most recent techniques and 
resources. </p>
<h4>Business Analytics</h4>
<p>In this course  you will 
learn to understand how business problems can be formulated with 
advanced analytics techniques as a potential solution. You will be able 
to reason on the organizational and managerial aspects of applying big 
data and analytics techniques and understand how prescriptive analytics 
and causal ML can help to use analytics for business decision-making. 
The course teaches you how analytical modelling techniques can be 
optimized and evaluated from a profit-driven perspective and how 
analytics techniques can exploit network-based information. </p>
<p>After
 following “Business Analytics”  you will know how to deal with 
unstructured data in the form of textual inputs  and how to use such 
data for practical business applications such as sentiment analysis or 
social media analytics. The course deals with how state-of-the-art 
explainability techniques can give insights into black-box machine 
learning models and how process mining techniques can be applied to data
 sets originating from process-aware information systems  including 
automated process discovery  conformance checking and extension. Upon 
completion of the course  you know which data science tools and 
environments are important for realizing applications of machine 
learning in business  including platforms such as Hadoop  Spark  etc  
which business applications might benefit from deep learning techniques 
 and how to apply them and evaluate their appropriateness.</p>

            <p>In this session  we provide a comprehensive guide on 
effectively responding to cyber-attacks within the bounds of the law. 
The presentation explores the intricate web of legal considerations that
 accompany cyber incidents  delving into the realms of criminal law  
data protection  privacy laws  and regulatory compliance together with 
all other possible side effects. </p>
<p>We begin by dissecting the 
anatomy of a cyber-attack through an incident response plan. A 
significant portion of the lecture is dedicated to the legal framework 
surrounding cyber-attacks. This includes an examination of data breach 
notification requirements  both domestically and internationally  as 
well as an exploration of the evolving landscape of cyber-related 
legislation. The discussion extends to the legal obligations imposed on 
organisations  shedding light on potential liabilities and consequences 
for non-compliance. </p>
<p>Furthermore  the lecture addresses  upon 
experiences learned  the critical role of digital forensics in incident 
response and legal proceedings. We gain an understanding of best

            <ul><li>You already have a degree and/or you are an innovative entrepreneur or ambitious business developer.</li>
	<li>You're passionate about technology and want to be a part of a quickly evolving world of AI</li>
	<li>You're creative and a problem solver.<br></li>
	<li>You enjoy analysing problems and finding systematic solutions.</li>
	<li>You know the basics of programming. No experience with programming? We recommend finishing a one-year programming course first. Afterwards you can enrol for this postgraduate degree.</li>
</ul>
        
            <h4>You are expected to master the basics of programming  so what does this entail?</h4>
<p>The postgraduate course is a very hands-on course. During the 
different workshops  you will usually use a computer and get to work 
with Python. You can find a lot of tutorials online about Python and 
programming. Main concepts you need to master are: variables  basic 
arithmic functions  string manipulations  looping and conditionals.<br>
An extensive knowledge of Python is required as we use extended standard libraries during the classes.</p>
<h4>Is attendance required for each class?</h4>
<p>There is no obligation. But the strength of the program is the 
personal interaction with teachers and students. All classes are also 
professionally streamed and recorded if you cannot attend every class 
live. There are also group works  so your attendance is recommended for 
those projects.</p>
<h4>When do the classes take place?</h4>
<p>Classes always take place on Tuesdays between 9 am and 6 pm at the latest  which allows for combination with work. </p>
<h4>What language is the course taught in?</h4>
<p>All courses are taught entirely in English. However  most teachers can also answer your questions in Dutch.</p>
        
            <p>We provide you with the necessary tools  techniques and insights to become an all-round player in the field of artificial intelligence. The first semester will be all about the foundations of artificial intelligence with deep insights into data science  machine learning and big data. The second semester will have a focus on practicality  where intelligent interfaces  NLP platforms  speech platforms  computer vision and robotics will be at the centre of our programme. Finally  you also get the opportunity to gain experience in the field during an internship at an AI company.</p>








<h4>AI fundamentals <br></h4>
<p>During the introductory week you will be immersed in various aspects 
of AI: how does AI learn  which techniques and applications are there  
and what are the pitfalls and limits that you have to take into account? <br></p>
<h4>Data Science <br></h4>
<p>You become acquainted with the entire work chain of the data 
scientist  from collecting and processing the data over modelling the 
problem to deliver the result to the customer. We always emphasize the 
pitfalls and the boundaries of AI and we ensure that our results are 
ethically responsible and safe. <br></p>
<h4>Machine Learning <br></h4>
<p>We dig deeper into the core of AI: machine learning. We deal with 
regression and classification  investigate the functioning of neural 
networks  deep learning  genetic algorithms  clustering  etc. We learn 
to train models using existing libraries  considering the limitations of
 the data set that we are starting from.</p>
<h4>IoT &amp; Big Data</h4>
<p>IoT is getting more and more important in our daily lives. Smart 
cities  industry 4.0  e-health  the applications are countless. Through 
this evolution  loads of data are being created that all have to find 
their way to the Cloud where they are processed into information that is
 of interest to the user. In this course we learn techniques to process 
and visualize large amounts of data in an efficient way. We are also 
introduced to the newest trend of edge computing that places less 
pressure on the Cloud. <br></p>
<h4>AI Project <br></h4>
<p>In this course  you will be immersed in state-of-the-art AI 
technologies to prepare you to develop your own project independently or
 as part of a team  under the guidance of our own AI experts. Previous 
student projects include:
- Smart Home with an AI model to manage your electricity use
- AI Platform that teaches you sign-language
- Drones that follow you based on facial recognition
- And many more... <br></p>
<h4>Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)</h4>
<p>In the professional and academical world a lot of models are created 
but only a few make it to deployment and/or production environment. The 
reason for this is that most AI-experts still manually organise their 
worksflows. Machine Learning Operation (MLOps) should bring an end to 
this. In this course we talk about the challenges within MLOps  the 
workflows and we will use industry standard MLOps tools.</p>
<h4>Internship (Optional) <br></h4>
<p>The internship offers students a unique opportunity to gain several weeks of hands-on experience at leading companies such as ML6  Imec and Human.ai. Students work on real AI projects  learn from experts and expand their professional network. This hands-on experience allows students to apply their acquired knowledge  gain insight into the day-to-day practice of AI and prepare for a successful career while making valuable connections with potential employers in the industry.</p>
        
            <p>After completing our postgraduate degree in Artificial Intelligence  students will have the crucial knowledge and skills to be successful in the AI domain. They will be able to apply machine learning and deep learning techniques  develop effective solutions to complex problems and integrate ethical considerations into AI applications. In addition  our programme offers extensive networking opportunities and access to top industry companies  such as ML6. Check out the blog where one of our students shares his inspiring internship experience at ML6  where he gained valuable hands-on experience and contributed to pioneering projects. Invest in your future and open the door to a rewarding career in the fast-growing world of artificial intelligence with our postgraduate degree.</p>

Legal Protection by Design for AI Systems, Mireille Hildebrandt of VUB LSTS|https://www.vaia.be/en/courses/legal-protection-by-design-for-ai-systems||Webinar Sense &amp; Sensibility of AI series with Mireille Hildebrandt (VUB)-Online-VAIA ||English|Online|Target audience: researchers with insight into the technical aspects of AI &amp; machine learning||masters degree|gratis||<p>How to build in legal protection into the development and deployment of AI Systems, constructing them with more than good intentions, yet based on norms agreed by a democratic legislature.</p>||"
            <p>AI systems in the broad sense of the term increasingly inform everyday life  from smart energy grids to connected cars and from social security fraud detection to search engines  recommender systems and other types of behavioural micro targeting. In this lecture Prof. Hildebrandt will discuss how the legal framework of fundamental rights in the EU combines with data protection law and the upcoming legal framework for AI systems. At their core  these legal architectures require that legal protection is built into the development and deployment of AI systems  requiring acuity and foresight from those who put these systems on the market. I will explain that this is not about good intentions or laudable ethical inclinations  but about developers  providers and deployers operating under the rule of law  following the norms agreed by the democratic legislature. Finally  I will explain why law is not about obstructing innovation  but about enabling innovation that addresses and enhances human agency. We don’t want ‘humans in the loop’  we need humans in charge.</p>

            <p>The past few years  significant technological advances have been made
 related to artificial intelligence algorithms that aim at improving 
quality of care  improving workflow efficiency  or supporting healthcare
 professionals. Many research institutes  universities and (startup) 
companies consider the healthcare sector as an attractive market and 
have invested large amounts into development of state-of-the-art AI 
algorithms. Despite these large investments  adoption of AI in real 
clinical practice remains fairly low. Many AI algorithms never leave the
 research labs or fail to pass regulatory approvals. This webinar will 
not only cover the potential that AI holds for use in healthcare 
applications  it will also discuss in detail the learnings and common 
challenges to bring an AI algorithm from a lab environment to broad 
clinical deployment.</p>

            <p>Warehouses are dynamic environments where different assets are continuously changing. Autonomous navigation nowadays often relies on floor markings and (static) prior maps which are created by driving around and scanning the surrounding environment. When augmented with vision technologies and AI algorithms  AGVs (Automated Guided Vehicles) can gain a spectacular amount of autonomy even in unmarked and unknown environments. In collaboration with researchers from University of Antwerp and KU Leuven  a proof of concept was made illustrating how Reinforcement Learning is used for automated inventory counting. Reinforcement learning methods learn through trial and error to interact with an unknown environment and hence  for safety reasons  this is often done in simulation. The step to the real environment is made safely by making use of the sensors on the AGVs.</p>

		<p>Subspace identification methods are attractive to identify MIMO linear systems via convex optimization problem and linear algebra decompositions. On the other hand  prediction error methods for this class of systems generally yield non-convex optimization problems. However in the latter case  available structure on the unknown model can be integrated in the identification problem.

            <p>The systems and control community has a long history of successful applications in engineering domains  traditionally making use of domain-specific knowledge and dynamic properties of systems. Machine learning has specialised in classification and regression from a black-box perspective  often using a Bayesian approach. Combining both offers opportunities  especially in efficiently optimising model structures and complexities for estimating models of measured dynamic systems  while imposing (interpretable) properties to these models.</p>
<p>This talk discusses the data-driven modelling of Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems with Gaussian Processes (GP) regression. First  GP regression in general  and Time domain and frequency domain expressions of LTI systems are reviewed. Then  relevant system-specific properties  s.a. causality and stability are encoded in kernels  used as prior knowledge for estimation purposes. Care is given to visual interpretations of this prior knowledge in the spectral domain. Finally  recent results are shared on the estimation of the more challenging situation  where the systems are lightly damped. The combination of the non-parametric local rational model (LRM) estimator with the GP regression approach is proposed.</p>

Decision Support for the Low Voltage Distribution Grid; the Role of Electricity Consumption Time Series|https://www.vaia.be/en/courses/machine-learning-approaches-for-analyzing-time-series-from-sports-2||Webinar AI for time series with Koen Vanthournout-online-KU Leuven STADIUS &amp; Flanders AI Research &amp; VAIA||English|online streaming|Target audience: anyone with an interest in AI and time series|||free||<p>The low voltage distribution grid delivers electricity to our houses and small businesses. Not only is it a critical infrastructure, on which our society depends, it is also a crucial component to realize the energy transition. As such, it is subject to radical (r)evolutions: distributed production (solar panels), electrification of transport and heating (electric cars and heat pumps). Nevertheless, our view on the state of the grid is limited at best, as it is a challenging environment, characterized by sparse and inaccurate data.</p>|"<a href=""https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Decision Support for the Low Voltage Distribution Grid; the Role of Electricity Consumption Time Series -&amp;&amp;url=https://www.vaia.be/en/courses/machine-learning-approaches-for-analyzing-time-series-from-sports-2"" onclick=""javascript:window.open(this.href, '', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=450,width=600'); return false;"" class=""mb-4 mr-4 btn"" title=""Share on Twitter"" tabindex=""-1"">                     <span class="""">Share this course</span>                     <svg class=""icon ml-2"" aria-hidden=""true""><use xlink:href=""https://www.vaia.be/icon/sprite.e929491684846e7cb33f.svg#twitter""></use></svg>                </a>"|"
            <p>After an introduction to the field  we will discuss how the marriage of power systems engineering and artificial intelligence can aid to improve the visibility on the low voltage distribution grid. This enables optimized use of the presently installed assets and helps to limit future investments  so the distribution grid becomes an enabler of the energy transition  rather than a costly bottleneck.</p>
<p>Of special importance to this work are the consumption and production profiles of individual connections to the grid: time series that describe our use of the grid. Despite the rollout of smart metering throughout Europe  measurements remain limited. And these time series are characterized by high stochasticity – human behavior  and are unbalanced – few  yet for us all-important power peaks. We will discuss the properties of electricity profiles  and the work to statistically model and ultimately forecast them.</p>

            <p>Migration research covers a wide range of disciplines and is 
typically conducted using different types of data  such as census data  
registers and surveys  collected by government agencies and national 
statistical offices. These data suffer from a series of limitations 
regarding resolution in time and space  making <strong>the analysis of a cross-border phenomenon like migration far from straightforwar</strong><strong>d</strong>.</p>
<p>Some promising contributions of the use of big data in migration research could include:</p>
<ul><li>studying patterns of <strong>temporary or circular migration</strong></li><li>timely monitoring of <strong>public opinion or media discourse </strong>on migration</li><li>improving opinion polls</li><li>providing evidence on aspects of migration of which we currently have limited knowledge  such as<ul><li>the <strong>integration prospects </strong>of recently arrived migrants in a country or</li><li><strong>future migration movements</strong> related to political or environmental conflicts.</li></ul></li></ul><p>New attempts to use big data analysis to understand human mobility and migration are promising  but are still in their infancy.<strong><br><br>While
 social big data is being proposed to fill some gaps and complement 
traditional data types  several AI applications are also being proposed 
to improve migration management.</strong> Some new approaches promise to
 enable new migration-related indices  with better resolution in time 
and space  as well as automated decision-making mechanisms for migration
 management. Again  analysis is difficult  as big data and AI may suffer
 from various biases and other problems. It remains to be seen how these
 technologies will actually improve migration management  and whether 
they will open new avenues for migration research.<br><br>In short  <strong>the use of AI and big data is a fundamental step for migration-related research</strong> 
 and yet their combination is very recent. Methodologically  a holistic 
approach is only possible by connecting the relevant international 
research infrastructures  different disciplines  civil society 
organisations and industry at national and international levels. </p>

            <p>In this talk Valera will introduce the concept of algorithmic recourse  which aims to help individuals affected by an unfavorable algorithmic decision to recover from it. First  she will show that while the concept of algorithmic recourse is strongly related to counterfactual explanations  existing methods for the later do not directly provide practical solutions for algorithmic recourse  as they do not account for the causal mechanisms governing the world. Then  she will show theoretical results that prove the need of complete causal knowledge to guarantee recourse and show how algorithmic recourse can be useful to provide novel fairness definitions that short the focus from the algorithm to the data distribution. Such novel definition of fairness allows us to distinguish between situations where unfairness can be better addressed by societal intervention  as opposed to changes on the classifiers. Finally  she will show practical solutions for (fairness in) algorithmic recourse  in realistic scenarios where the causal knowledge is only limited.</p>

from the perspective of the relevance of search engine results to people
 searching for information  i.e.  the extent to which the system

<p>Oh  and I'm not just talking about a face swap. I'm talking about actually generating a completely new face made of features of two original faces. And even better: what if I could find a way to visualize the morphing process from one face to the other? Let's see how far I got with my Frankenstein-ish experiment!</p>

Sequence modelling is a central part of cognitive systems. The notion of sequence can be thought of as an abstraction of time series used to account for cognitive flexibility in the perception of time. The goal of their work is to bridge the gap between unsupervised learning and knowledge-based reasoning in cognitive systems.</p>|"<a href=""https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Statistical Learning of Knowledge from Sequence Data -&amp;&amp;url=https://www.vaia.be/en/courses/statistical-learning-of-knowledge-from-sequence-data"" onclick=""javascript:window.open(this.href, '', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=450,width=600'); return false;"" class=""mb-4 mr-4 btn"" title=""Share on Twitter"" tabindex=""-1"">                     <span class="""">Share this course</span>                     <svg class=""icon ml-2"" aria-hidden=""true""><use xlink:href=""https://www.vaia.be/icon/sprite.e929491684846e7cb33f.svg#twitter""></use></svg>                </a>"|"
            <p>In this seminar Nick Harley will describe the theoretical background of his team’s approach and two different application contexts. The formal basis is a predictive modelling framework called IDyOM (Pearce  2005) which finds statistical patterns in multi-dimensional sequence data. Information theoretic measures are used to segment sequences into perceptual or cognitive units which then form the basis of a knowledge representation. One application of this method is in modelling music cognition  which involves the real-time organisation of low-level stimuli  such as notes  into high-level structures  such as chords and phrases. A second application is in reinforcement learning. Partial observability  dynamic environments  hidden rewards and explainability are problems for RL models. Supervised learning incorporating knowledge about sub-tasks can mitigate these problems. Harley will describe how statistical modelling of agent behaviour sequences can be used to learn sub-task knowledge in an unsupervised manner. He will finish with a discussion of the open challenges we are addressing and invite the audience to participate in a discussion.</p>

            <p>Due to the proliferation of whole-slide-imaging (WSI) digital scanners it is now possible to leverage computer vision  image analysis  and machine learning techniques  such as deep learning to process the digital pathology images in hopes to derive  diagnosis and prognosis markers. The convergence of digital imaging  data science and pathology gave rise to a new research area known as digital pathology. Digital pathology greatly enhances diagnostic accuracy and allows a variety of pathology tasks to be completed with greater efficiency. This presentation will offer a general introduction to the topic  it will outline and discuss imaging tasks needed for the successful implementation of a digital pathology pipeline  and it will offer overview and insights on how data-driven solutions such as deep neural networks can be used to derive markers from digital pathology slides. It will also be shown that a diagnostic system that combines deep learning and prior histological knowledge can provide useful diagnostic/prognostic markers. Lastly  open research issues and implementation challenges will be briefly discussed.<br></p>

            <p>Progress in solving challenging problems in artificial intelligence  computer science at large and beyond  is driven to a significant extent by competition - regular algorithm competitions as well as comparative performance evaluation against state-of-the-art methods from the literature. A prominent example for this is the satisfiability problem in propositional logic (SAT)  an NP-hard problem that not only lies at the foundations of computer science  but also plays a key role in many real-world applications  notably in ensuring the correctness of hard- and software. In this presentation  Holger Hoos argues that it is time to rethink the way we assess the state of the art in solving problems such as SAT and the incentives for improving it. Hoos demonstrates how automated algorithm selection and configuration techniques based on sophisticated machine learning and optimisation methods have fundamentally changed not only the state of the art in solving SAT and many other NP-hard problems  but also provide a natural basis for cooperative competition - a new approach for achieving and assessing progress not merely in solving these problems  but also in the way we approach them as a scientific community.</p>

<p>In this seminar  we will review what Large Language Models (LLMs) are
 and see how they are currently used in Natural Language Processing 
(NLP). I will first briefly go over the developments in the NLP field 
that led to LLMs. After describing what LLMs are and highlighting their 
advantages and disadvantages  we will delve into their current uses in 
NLP. Finally  I will go over some of my own research  investigating what
 LLMs capture of pragmatics.</p>

            <p><em>This course will be given by <strong>Prof. Rob Heyman on Friday 22 March 2024 from 9.30 to 16:30 CET at the FARI Test &amp; Experience Center</strong> (Cantersteen 16  1000  Brussels).</em></p>
<p>The problems or challenges we wish to address in this 1-day course are:</p>
<p>Adopt AI or die: there is a push to use a form of artificial 
intelligence for each organization  and failure to do so seems to imply 
the end of your organization’s history. But how do you ensure that your 
investments in AI are sustainable and successfully adopted by your 
colleagues and employees?</p>
<p>While you are adapting to this new technological context  you will also have to deal with new regulations. How will you do this?</p>
<p>Lastly  adopting technological and legal change is not something you 
do on your own  so what are methods to facilitate this change in your 
organization?</p>
        
            <p>While not absolutely necessary  it helps to have a clear challenge in
 mind when joining this session. Rob will invite you to work on your 
innovation case or with someone in case you lack one.</p>
<p>Knowledge of legal frameworks or AI is not necessary.</p>
        
            <h4>Session 1: How to and how not to Introduce Automation on the Work Floor</h4>
<p>We will look at practical  theoretical concepts to understand 
innovation on the work floor and the tension between users and 
technology. The aim is to understand all successful technology 
adoptions as innovations that change users’ daily practices.</p>
<p>Next  we discuss cases where AI or industry 4.0 applications were 
introduced and what these meant for different stakeholders. If you have a
 case  you wish to discuss  be sure to contact Rob Heyman to discuss 
this as part of the session.</p>
<h4>Session 2: Boosting Operational Efficiency by Reducing Digital Friction and Increasing Agility</h4>
<p>If you believe innovation can only be successful if practices change  then it follows that regulations can only be successful if regulations change practices  too. In this part we look at the particular challenges we experienced during the implementation of the GDPR and what this might mean for the implementation of the AI Act.</p>
<h4>Session 3: Improving Information Protection and Governance</h4>
<p>During the last part of the day  we will use a case for innovation of your choosing and define a workshop or process to include colleagues and employees in this process. In this interactive part  you will learn a few facilitation methods and the key ingredients to define co-creation projects on your work floor.</p>
        
            <p>This training was designed for decision
 makers from public organizations that want to fully empower workforces 
with flexible digital workplaces  increased agility and stronger 
information protection to address current business needs and evolving 
challenges.</p>
<p>As FARI is supported by the European Resilience &amp; Recovery Fund (RRF)  we can continue to offer <strong>free access</strong> to participants from <strong>public administrations</strong>  <strong>public institutions</strong> and <strong>research institutions</strong>.</p>
<p>We can also provide a <strong>50% discount</strong> to participants from the following target groups:</p><ul><li><strong>Educational institutions</strong></li><li><strong>NGOs and non-profit organisations</strong><strong><br></strong></li><li><strong>Brussels based companies</strong><strong><br></strong></li><li><strong>Brussels citizens</strong></li></ul>

Bender, CMAP, École Polytechnique|<p>A classical approach to solving polynomial systems is to linearize the problem and reduce it to an eigenvalue calculation. For this purpose, certain families of special matrices are used, e.g., Sylvester and Dixon matrices. Their size and structure determine how far these methods can go; therefore, it is essential to construct better matrices for the specific systems that arise in practice. </p>|"
            <p>In this talk  we focus on polynomial systems coming from the multiparameter eigenvalue problem and certain generalizations. Using the theory of resultants and Weyman complexes  we present new matrices of optimal size for solving these systems. This talk is based on joint work with Jean Charles Faugère  Angelos Mantzaflaris  and Elias Tsigaridas.</p>

<p>This program is structured into four distinct modules and provides a 
comprehensive exploration of Europe’s evolving regulatory landscape 
related to data and artificial intelligence. It encompasses a range of 
frameworks  operational tools  and best practices crucial for ensuring 
compliance. Designed for professionals in both the public and private 
sectors  the course aims to guide participants in complying with 
relevant European regulations  while also enabling them to capitalize on
 the new opportunities emerging from the European regulatory framework.</p>
<p>The modules are structured to create a cohesive and comprehensive 
program. However  participants have the flexibility to choose individual
 modules ‘à la carte’ according to their interests or needs. It’s 
important to note that we strongly recommend completing Module 3 before 
proceeding to Module 4. This sequence ensures a more effective learning 
experience  as the content of Module 3 lays the foundational knowledge 
necessary for understanding Module 4.</p>
<p>This program is tailored for professionals across various fields. 
However  it does not delve deeply into the unique aspects of specific 
sectors such as banking and finance  health  work &amp; employment  
critical infrastructures  enforcement  justice  machinery  etc. If you 
are interested in a customized program that specifically addresses the 
needs and nuances of your organization or company  please do not 
hesitate to get in touch. We are more than willing to collaborate with 
you to develop a program that aligns perfectly with your sector’s 
specific requirements and challenges.<em><br></em></p>

            <p>Medicine has a distinct set of moral responsibilities. This is because the physician-patient relationship contains inherent inequalities of knowledge  skills  and control of resources  and it treats matters both intimate and potentially of great importance to the patient (Rhodes 2001; Nickel &amp; Frank 2020). These responsibilities include physician’s obligation to earn trust and be trustworthy (Rhodes 2001; 2020). The field of psychiatric medicine faces additional ethical challenges specifically related to patient trust. As artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies (in diagnosis  relapse prevention  and treatment) begin to play a larger role in all medicine  and specifically psychiatry  these ethical challenges may be exacerbated or complicated. In this talk I present three of these challenges relating to patient testimony  false empowerment  and harm prevention.</p>

            <p>Major progress and impact has been achieved through deep learning architectures with many exciting applications such as by generative models and transformers. At the same time it triggers new questions on the fundamental possibilities and limitations of the models  with respect to representations  scalability  learning and generalisation aspects. Through kernel-based methods often a deeper understanding and solid foundations have been obtained  complementary to the powerful and flexible deep learning architectures. Recent examples are understanding generalisation of over-parameterised models in the double descent phenomenon and conceiving attention mechanisms in transformers as kernel machines.</p>

            <p><em>Inaugural lecture of the Kulak Francqui Chair 2024 by Prof. Dr. Marco Zorzi</em></p>
<p>Deep learning in artificial neural networks is the driving force behind the contemporary revolution brought by AI technologies. <strong>Deep neural networks</strong>
 show impressive performance in a wide range of domains  from image 
processing to natural language understanding. What insights can we 
derive from these “artificial brains” about the human mind and brain? 
Conversely  can we use <strong>behavioural and neuroscientific methods</strong> to test and challenge these <strong>AI systems</strong>?</p>
<p>In this talk  Professor Marco Zorzi will discuss interdisciplinary research that emphasizes a <strong>constant dialogue between cognitive (neuro)science and AI. </strong>Contrasting
 humans and machines in terms of learning and performance  including 
failures  is the key to deepen our understanding of human cognition and 
to highlight necessary improvements in AI technologies.</p>

		Explaining and Predicting Outcomes with Linear Regression
	
                            <p>Linear regression addresses how a continuous dependent variable is associated by one or more predictors of any type. The fact that many practical problems deal with continuous outcomes (e.g. income  blood pressure  temperature  affect) makes linear regression a popular tool  and most of us will be familiar with the concept of drawing a line through a cloud of data points.<br></p>
<p>The first two sessions of this module introduce the conceptual framework of this method using the simple case of a single predictor. Formulas and technicalities are kept to a minimum and the main focus is on interpretation of results and assessing model validity. This includes confidence statements on the predictor effect (hypothesis tests and confidence intervals)  using the regression model to predict future results and verification of model assumptions.</p>
<p>In session 3 and 4 we allow for more than one predictor leading to the multiple linear regression model. We focus on either explanation or prediction. How to come to a parsimonious model starting from a large number of predictors will be discussed in detail. In these complex linear models special attention will be given to interpreting individual predictor effects  as they critically depend on other terms in the model and underlying relations between predictors (confounding).</p>
<p>In the last session a more elaborate data analysis is discussed. We touch on problems where linear regression is not appropriate and replaced by related approaches such as generalized linear models and mixed models.</p>
<p>Different features will be illustrated with case examples from the instructors practical experience  and participants are encouraged to bring examples from their own work.</p>
<p>Hands-on exercises are worked out behind the PC using the R software.</p>
<h2>Target audience</h2>
<p>This course targets professionals and investigators from all areas who are involved in prediction problems or need to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more explanatory variables.</p>
<h2>Fees</h2>
<p>The participation fee is 1100 EUR for participants from the private sector. Reduced prices apply to students and staff from non-profit  social profit  and government organizations. An exam fee of 35 EUR will be applied.</p>
<ul><li>Industry  private sector  profession*: <strong>€ 1100</strong></li><li>Non profit  government  higher education staff: <strong>€ 825</strong></li><li>(Doctoral) students  unemployed: <strong>€ 495</strong></li></ul>
<p>*If two or more employees from the same company enrol simultaneously for this course a reduction of 20% on the course fee is taken into account starting from the second enrolment.</p>

            <p>This overview course is structured into <strong>seven sessions. </strong>We start with an overview of <strong>methodologies and technologies </strong>
 beginning with a holistic view of cybersecurity in a digital ecosystem 
(session 1). Cybersecurity plays a critical role in ensuring <strong>data privacy</strong> 
 which involves complying with privacy laws and regulations like GDPR 
(session 2). The programme then progresses to hands-on workshops: one 
focused on network security (session 3) and another on the protection of
 the growing category of embedded<strong> ‘IoT’ devices</strong> (session 4). As <strong>standards and certifications </strong>also
 play an increasing role in implementing cybersecurity measures  this is
 the focus of the next session (session 5). We learn how (not) to <strong>respond  </strong>when a cyberattack occurs  and hear the lessons learned from a 'victim' (Session 6). Finally  we look ahead to what <strong>the future</strong> holds  especially in the context of cybersecurity in the era of quantum computing (Session 7).</p>

            <p>This introductory session provides insight into the complexity of the security puzzle that needs to be solved. A wide range of building blocks for developing and maintaining digital applications and infrastructure is presented. Each of these puzzle pieces serves a specific purpose and addresses a portion of the cybersecurity challenges. During the session  it becomes clear that cybersecurity is a concern throughout the entire lifecycle of digital systems. Furthermore  a silver bullet is unfortunately not on the table. We focus on methodologies and technologies for the development of secure digital applications.</p>

<p>Operational decisions are an important part of knowledge-intensive organizations  as these are taken in a high volume on a daily basis. However  describing these decisions in a standardized format such as DMN is a time-consuming task  as various textual sources need to be analyzed. In this talk  we present the results of our experiments on an automated approach to generating decision tables from natural language based on the GPT-3 LLM. Through a total of 72 experiments over six problem descriptions  we evaluated GPT-3’s decision logic modeling and reasoning capabilities. While GPT-3 demonstrates promising abilities in extracting decision context and identifying relevant variables from natural language  further enhancements are needed to improve its decision table capabilities for efficient automation of DMN modeling.</p>
        
            <p><em>by Ioannis Dasoulas</em></p>
<p>An abundance of tabular data exists and is used by a wide range of applications. However  a big portion of these data lack the semantic information necessary for users and machines to properly understand them. This lack of table semantic understanding impedes their usage in data analytics pipelines. Existing solutions are focused on specific annotation tasks and types of tables  and rely solely on large knowledge bases  making it difficult to re-use in real-world settings. In this talk  we present TorchicTab  a<br>versatile semantic table interpretation system able to annotate tables with varied structures by using either an external knowledge graph  such as Wikidata  or annotated tables with pre-defined terms for training. The results demonstrate TorchicTab’s ability to produce accurate annotations for different tasks across varied datasets.</p>

Its special case is the problem of finding real solutions of a system of polynomial equations. This difficult problem has many applications in fields such as statistics, signal processing, machine learning, computer vision, computational geometry, and control engineering. The Moment-SOS hierarchy is an approach to polynomial optimization that solves it globally at the price of solving a family of convex (semidefinite) optimization problems of increasing size.</p>|"

		Methods for the analysis of high dimensional data
	
                            <p>Modern high throughput technologies easily generate data on thousands of variables; e.g. health care data  genomics  chemometrics  environmental monitoring  web logs  movie ratings  … Conventional statistical methods are no longer suited for effectively analysing such high-dimensional data. Multivariate statistical methods may be used  but for often the dimensionality of the data set is much larger than the number of (biological) samples. Modern advances in statistical data analyses allow for the appropriate analysis of such data. Methods for the analysis of high dimensional data rely heavily on multivariate statistical methods. Therefore a large part of the course content is devoted to multivariate methods  but with a focus on high dimensional settings and issues. Multivariate statistical analysis covers many methods. In this course a selection of techniques is covered based on our experience that they are frequently used in industry and research institutes. The course is taught using case studies with applications from different fields (analytical chemistry  ecology  biotechnology  genomics  …).<br></p>

The roots are found by computing the eigenvalues of the associated companion matrix. A companion matrix is an upper Hessenberg matrix that is of unitary-plus-rank-one form, that is, it is the sum of a unitary matrix and a rank-one matrix. When running Francis’s implicitly-shifted QR algorithm this property is preserved, and exactly that is exploited here.</p>|"
            <p>To compactly store the matrix we will show that only 3n-1 rotators are required  so the storage space is O(n). In fact  these rotators only represent the unitary part  but we will show that we can retrieve the rank-one part from the unitary part with a trick. It is thus not necessary to store the rank-one part explicitly. Francis’s algorithm tuned for working on this representation requires only O(n) flops per iteration and thus O(n²) flops in total. The algorithm is normwise backward stable and is shown to be about as accurate as the (slow) Francis QR algorithm applied to the companion matrix without exploiting the structure. It is also faster than other O(n²) methods that have been proposed  and its accuracy is comparable or better.</p>

Starting from a holistic perspective, it covers the interactions between technology, humans and processes throughout the lifecycle of scoping, managing and delivering an AI project. This hands-on training provides actionable AI innovation toolkits and teaches how to use them within a specific context, including a use case of your own.</p>|"
            <p>The programme
 is organised around the different dimensions of innovation instead of 
around AI  because the specific context of an institution plays a 
crucial factor in innovation  and a better connecting factor than an 
unknown and often misunderstood scientific field like AI.</p>
<p>However  because of the many prejudices 
among novices in the domain of AI  and the wildly varying backgrounds  
we will start with a compulsory module to introduce AI. Equally  we 
include a final and compulsory “case study” module where the students 
need to integrate what they have learnt  honing their holistic 
understanding of AI and innovation  as well as their interdisciplinary 
skills. These case studies will be published online and serve as 
marketing materials.</p>
        
            <p>Please note that for the first edition of the program (February-June 2024)  <strong>only people with a degree from a <u>Belgian university</u> will be able to apply.</strong></p>
<p>For those with a degree from outside Belgium  applications will open in June 2024.</p>
<p>The program has been developed for 
professionals and recent graduates with an affinity for IT  and that are
 directly or indirectly involved  or wish to be involved in innovation 
with AI. This means the training is particularly useful for you in the 
following roles:</p>

<ul><li>Innovation  project and product <em>managers<br></em></li><li>Functional <em>analyst</em>  solution &amp; enterprise a<em>rchitects</em></li><li>Project officers at funding agencies</li><li>Business developers</li><li>HR managers and recruiters</li><li>Legals</li></ul>

This is  particularly true for <strong>demand forecasting and planning</strong>,  where the recent surge in data has prompted a paradigm shift.  Historically, forecasting was dominated by simple statistical  forecasting methods. However, <strong>machine learning-based forecasting</strong>  has recently outperformed all sales forecasting competitions with  superior performance. Despite these advancements, most companies still  rely heavily on simple statistical forecasting techniques.</p>|"
            <p>In this seminar  three experts share their knowledge and 
experience using AI in forecasting and demand planning. We showcase the 
effectiveness of AI forecasting using tree-based machine learning and 
outline the conditions in which these methods surpass popular 
statistical approaches. Next  we will explore the essential elements of a
 good AI demand/sales forecast beyond mere accuracy  delving into 
probability forecasting  explainability  stability  and more. Finally  
we provide a guide for achieving demand planning excellence through 
objectives  data  metrics  models  and enrichment. We also discuss how 
teams can enrich ML-generated forecasts using the famous forecast 
value-added framework.</p>
<p>These three experts are <strong>Arnoud Wellens</strong> (Postdoctoral researcher in forecasting  KU Leuven)  <strong>Ruben Crevits</strong> (Lead data scientist  OMP  PhD in forecasting) and <strong>Nicolas Vandeput</strong> (Supply chain data scientist  CEO &amp; founder  Author).</p>

		In this course we will focus on correct execution of data analysis and understanding its results. We pay attention to expressing these conclusions in a correct and understandable way.
	
                            <p>To emphasize the practical approach in this course all classes will take place in a pc room.<br></p>
<p>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a statistical tool used in the comparison of means of a random variable over populations that differ in one or more characteristics (factors)  e.g. treatment  age  sex  subject  etc.</p>
<p>First  we cover one-way ANOVA  where only one factor is of concern. Depending on the type of the factor  the conclusions pertain to just those factor levels included in the study (fixed factor model)  or to a population of factor levels of which we observed a sample (random effects model).</p>
<p>In two-way and multi-way ANOVA where populations differ in more than one characteristic  the effects of factors are studied simultaneously. This yields information about the main effects of each of the factors as well as about any special joint effects (factorial design).</p>
<p>We also consider nested designs  where each level of a second (mostly random) factor occurs in conjunction with only one level of the first factor. One special challenge in multi-way ANOVA lies in verifying the assumptions that must be satisfied.</p>
<p>In this course we will focus on correct execution of data analysis and understanding its results. We pay attention to expressing these conclusions in a correct and understandable way.</p>
<p>The different methods will be extensively illustrated with examples from scientific studies in a variety of fields.</p>
<p>Exercises are worked out behind PC using the R software.</p>
<h2>Target audience</h2>
<p>This course targets professionals and investigators from diverse areas  who need to use statistical methods in the collection and handling of data in their research  in particular for assessing the effect of e.g. different treatments.</p>
<h2>Fees</h2>
<p>The participation fee is 1100 EUR for participants from the private sector. Reduced prices apply to students and staff from non-profit  social profit  and government organizations. An exam fee of 35 EUR will be applied.</p>

		Data wrangling and visualization challenges  using the best parts of R tidyverse.
	
                            <p>Tidyverse is a collection of R-packages used for data wrangling and visualization that share a common design philosophy. The goal of this course is to get you up to speed with the most up-to-date and essential tidyverse tools for data exploration. After attending this course  you’ll have the tools to tackle a wide variety of data wrangling and visualization challenges  using the best parts of R tidyverse.<br></p>
<p>This course covers the most essential tools from 3 main R tidyverse packages that are frequently used in general data analysis procedure. Lectures with R code demonstrations are blended with hands-on exercises which allows you to try out the tools you’ve seen in the class under guides.</p>
<p>What you will learn:</p>
<ul><li>Data transforming and summarizing with dplyr: narrowing in on observations of interest  creating new variables that are functions of existing variables  and calculating a set of summary statistics (like counts or means)</li><li>Data visualization with ggplot2: creating more informative graphs (e.g.  scatter plot  bar plot  histogram  smoother/regression line  …) in an elegant and efficient way. Arranging multiple plots on a grid</li><li>Data ingest and tidying with tidyr: storing it in a consistent form that matches the semantics of the dataset with the way it is stored.</li><li>Extra tools for programming: Merging and comparing two datasets based on various matching or filtering criterion. Other useful tools for R programming.</li></ul>

            <p>
	Artificial Intelligence takes many forms. One of those of widest 
relevance for our universities is the passionately discussed chatbot 
application ChatGPT  launched in November 2022 by OpenAI. In a matter of
 seconds  it can produce texts that sound like well-informed answers to 
any possible question  react to users’ objections and summarize long 
texts. Its potential is evident in many fields  including all aspects of
 university life.</p>
<p>
	<br>
	But it also constitutes  along with related AI applications  a 
formidable challenge  not least for the way we teach and evaluate our 
students. The texts ChatGPT generates  whether concise or richly 
developed  often seem to provide students with all they need to perform 
many tasks currently assigned to them as homework  tests or exams. 
Should we regulate  restrict or even forbid their use of ChatGPT?</p>
<p>
	<br>
	Should we on the contrary encourage our students to use it and 
radically redesign how we evaluate them? Should we even rethink in depth
 what we need to teach them: why bother trying to teach them to write 
texts in their own and other languages if ChatGPT can do that far better
 for them? Should we concentrate instead on teaching our students 
critical thinking skills?</p>
<p>
	<br>
	Or should we rather be primarily worried about the unwarranted trust 
which our students will unavoidably nourish for ChatGPT’s answers  or 
about the many biases that affect unwittingly the information that is 
reaching them  or about the huge ecological cost of the worldwide 
operation of AI applications?</p><h5>

<p>In the era of AI and Data  it's crucial to shift our focus from merely seeking answers to understanding the importance of questions. While answers provide clarity and guidance  they are often the culmination of a questioning process that can lead to more inquiries. Albert Einstein emphasized the significance of how questions are framed  as this framing can heavily influence the answers we find. Yet  as a society  we often overlook the art of questioning: who asks the questions  their formulation  their impact on research  and our decision-making processes. Moreover  we frequently fail to scrutinize whether the answers truly address the initial questions. In this talk  I will highlight our transition to being data-rich but question-poor. I will advocate for the development of 'question science' as a complement to data science and the necessity of cultivating 'questions literacy' to better utilize the vast amounts of data at our disposal.</p>
        
            <h5>Angeliki Giannakopoulou – <a href=""#eaea-europe"" tabindex=""-1"">EAEA</a>  Europe</h5>
<p>This presentation delves into the experiences of the AI4AL project  a European initiative navigating the landscape of adult education and exploring a mindful adoption of AI. In response to prevalent mistrust among adult educators regarding AI  the project undertakes a horizontal approach of co-creation with the adult learning community  through the direct involvement of educators and learners. The results of this cooperation are an essential pool of experience shared in a Wiki-based Online Scenarios Repository  an AI matching tool linking digital skills assessment to learning offers for under-represented learners  and a self-paced learning path for educators on AI demystification and integration to the learning process. </p>
        
            <h5>Ville Valtonen – <a href=""#minnalearn-finland"" tabindex=""-1"">MinnaLearn</a>  Finland</h5>
<p>The need for teaching and learning AI is only growing yet the number of capable teachers is not. MOOCs provide excellent scale yet learning with them is lonely and not always effective  especially when trying to learn at work - there is always something more urgent to do. We propose a solution that combines learning materials and facilitation plans. With the help of these  anybody can facilitate high quality learning at their workplace.</p>
        
            <h5>Llanos Tobarra Abad – <a href=""#uned-spain"" tabindex=""-1"">UNED</a>  Spain</h5>
<p>UNED offers various trainings approaches oriented to artificial intelligence at various levels of complexity in order to cover the different stages of formation and stages of the working life of today's society. From massive open courses for those who want to approach artificial intelligence from scratch to the preparation of future developers of new IA models and their applications.</p>
<p>We must be aware that if we want to prepare future professionals for an environment as challenging and in constant evolution as artificial intelligence  the formation offered in this area must not only focus on applications (such as robotics  natural language processing or data science) but must also pay attention to the theoretical foundations of the discipline (addressing topics such as logic  probability  machine learning and computer vision). By combining both approaches  offering a comprehensive artificial intelligence learning path  we will be able to reduce the gap between the academic environment and the working context. And to achieve this goal  an indispensable pillar is the collaboration with public entities  companies and national and international researchers  through agreements  collaboration networks and research projects<strong>.</strong></p>
        
            <h5>Michael Kircher – <a href=""#ai-campus-germany-at-a-glance"" tabindex=""-1"">AI Campus</a>  Germany</h5>
<p>We have recognized the need for widespread AI literacy and present our vision of an AI-competent society through free and high-quality digital learning opportunities. Our mission is to bolster AI proficiency through universal access to complimentary digital education  targeting a broad demographic inclusive of students  professionals  and perpetual learners.</p>
<p>The AI Campus emerges as a comprehensive learning platform  meticulously crafted to facilitate not only the comprehension and critique of AI systems but also to enable hands-on design and professional application. The cornerstone of our approach is ""AI Campus Originals""  a bespoke collection of educational resources  coupled with a curation of external learning opportunities enhanced by our platform's amplification. Regional hubs  with a keen focus on demand  disseminate these resources  ensuring integration of both online and blended learning experiences.</p>
<p>We adopt a holistic educational philosophy  underpinning our vision with a commitment to early intervention. Beginning at the elementary level  we champion data literacy  setting the foundation for a lifelong journey of AI mastery. Our methodology utilizes teachers as pivotal conduits  fostering a sustainable development of skills that ripple through the entire educational biography.</p>
<p>Our dual-tiered learning paradigm on the AI-Campus is calibrated to synchronize with learners' evolving needs:</p>
<p>The first level delivers a base of information and knowledge through a mix of micro-formats  MOOCs  and live events.</p>
<p>The second level advances to skills acquisition  incorporating interactive micro-learning modules  skill-specific MOOCs  and blended learning environments.</p>
<p>Further  our platform recognizes achievement and advancement through a system of digital badges  micro-credentials  and degrees  ensuring that learners have tangible evidence of their proficiency.</p>
<p>This keynote delineates our ambition to bridge the gap between informal learning and formal education. By providing open-license  high-caliber digital education opportunities  we envision a future where lifelong learning is not merely an aspirational concept but an integral part of the societal fabric  enabling individuals to adapt  innovate  and to help shape an AI-driven world in a critical and reflective way.</p>
        
            <h5>Steph Wright – <a href=""#scottish-ai-alliance-scotland"" tabindex=""-1"">Scottish AI Alliance</a>  Scotland</h5>
<p>Scotland’s AI Strategy sets out a vision for Scotland to become a leader in the development and use of trustworthy  ethical and inclusive AI. In order to achieve this vision  the Scottish AI Alliance is committed to ensure that everyone in Scotland can participate in the journey towards Scotland’s AI future. In addition to meaningful engagement with its communities  the AI Alliance strives to empower the people of Scotland with the knowledge of AI to enable them to constructively and critically contribute to the conversations about the who  what  where  when and why of AI. One of the tools developed to do this is Living with AI  a fun  free and interactive online course aimed at the general public introducing them to AI  the challenges around fairness and bias  and then takes them on a five week journey on how AI impacts their everyday lives. Soft launched in September  the course has received overwhelmingly positive feedback so far but many lessons were learnt!</p>
        
            <h5>Solenn Daudu – <a href=""#aivancity-france"" tabindex=""-1"">aivancity</a>  France</h5>
<p>In its ""Future of Jobs Report 2023""  the World Economic Forum says that <em>""6 in 10 workers will require training before 2027  but only half of workers are seen to have access to adequate training opportunities today"".</em> Also  <em>""training workers to utilize AI and big data ranks third among company skills-training priorities in the next five years and will be prioritized by 42% of surveyed companies.""</em></p>
<p>In that sense  it is crucial that higher education institutions - seeing broader than those teaching about AI - prepare their students and young graduates not only for their first job  but also for all the ones coming after. As we know  professional careers will be less and less linear  young graduates hopping from one experience  one company to the other  maybe even creating their own on the way. Especially in the digital sector  students should be able to learn  unlearn and relearn (Alvin Toffler).</p>
<p>This is why aivancity took lead in creating the guarantee of the diploma lifetime update©  the first if its kind  at least in France. The guarantee is available to graduates of the Grande École Program for 10 years  and to Bachelors and MSc for 5 years – it is offered to them  for life  in exchange for a subscription taken out after the guarantee period. This ensures graduates can come back to the institution for years after their graduation to be trained alongside current students  favouring experience sharing  diversity and inclusion in class and in particular long-term employability.</p>
<p>That way  they keep their skills and knowledge constantly updated  facilitating career development  strengthening of their professional integration and adequation with the current and future needs of the market. </p>

            <p>Event-based technology is developing at a fast pace (e.g. via 
neuromorphic computing and event-based cameras) but we currently lack a 
control theory of event-based systems. The general aim is to conceive 
physical machines that combine the reliability of discrete automata and 
the robustness and adaptation of physical control systems.</p>
<p>The theory of mixed feedback systems aims at leveraging the existing 
theory of control  optimization  and learning while acknowledging the 
inherent out-of-equilibrium nature of event-based machines.</p>
<p>The theory is grounded in the operator-theoretic framework of maximal
 monotonicity in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces. The course will 
introduce those mathematical tools at a basic level and present how they
 can be used to analyze and design neuromorphic event-based machines.</p>
        
            <p>The course consists of six sessions over three days. Each session will cover one of the following modules</p>
<h5>Module1: Feedback and memory (RS)</h5>
<p>1.1. Examples of mixed feedback systems. Motivation. Current 
limitations of control theory  machine learning  and neuromorphic 
engineering.</p>
<p>1.2. Static mixed feedback</p>
<p>1.3. Dynamic mixed feedback. Questions and challenges</p>
<h5>Module 2: Feedback system analysis (TC)</h5>
<p>2.1. Systems as operators. Phase and Gain. Monotonicity and Lipschitz operators. The passivity and the small-gain theorems.</p>
<p>2.2. Graphical representations. Nyquist plots. Scaled Relative Graphs.</p>
<p>2.3. Mixed feedback systems. Mixed gain and mixed phase feedback systems.</p>
<h5>Module 3: Feedback algorithms (TC)</h5>
<p>3.1. Fixed point algorithms and zero finding algorithms.</p>
<p>3.2. Splitting algorithms and circuit representations</p>
<p>3.3. Algorithmic solutions of mixed feedback systems</p>
<h5>Module 4: Modelling at scale (RS)</h5>
<p>4.1. Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces</p>
<p>4.2. Gradient systems in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces</p>
<p>4.3. Feedback neural networks at scale</p>

            <p>In recent years  much attention has been paid to the use of 
innovation and technology in order  on the one hand  to provide faster 
and better coordination in critical situations and  on the other hand  
to enrich large amounts of data into useful information that can help 
make informed decisions. Within the safety &amp; security domain  it is a
 challenge to inform individuals and organizations working together 
around a common problem in such a way that activities can be developed.</p>
<p>This means that sufficient information must be present to coordinate 
activities  while access to information must be possible within the 
network. Without these two conditions  it is impossible to address a 
security threat or coordinate a crisis. </p>
<p>Those challenges create several issues regarding the coordination of 
information  the integration of technology within and between 
organizations and networks  the use of Generative Artificial 
Intelligence to achieve better decision-making  etc. In this lecture

                            <h2>Description</h2>
<p>This course aims to provide insight into basic statistical concepts with emphasis on practical applications. Mathematical formulae will be kept to a minimum. The theory and the methods of analysis will be extensively illustrated with examples relating to a wide variety of different fields. To emphasize the <strong>practical approach</strong> in this course all classes will take place in a pc room.</p>
<p>The practical part of the first session (after the break) will be dedicated to getting to know the software package R. Participants are encouraged to participate in both parts.</p>
<p>We start with concise graphical and numerical descriptions of data obtained from observational or experimental studies. The most common and frequently used probability distributions of discrete and continuous variables will be presented. Statistical inference draws conclusions about a population based on sampled data. Chance variations are taken into account such that a level of confidence is attached to these conclusions.</p>
<p>We present the reasoning behind significance tests for the comparison of observed data with a hypothesis  the validity of which we want to assess. We apply this procedure to data obtained either from one or from two populations.</p>
<p>The correct use of the t-test will be discussed. Nonparametric methods are considered as a possible alternative in case the requirements of the t-test are not met.</p>
<p>We cover the basic concepts of hypothesis testing for categorical data  including the chi-square test.</p>
<p>Quite often the relationship between two variables  where the outcome of one variable is seen as depending on the value of the other  is the focus of scientific interest.</p>
<p>We will give an introduction to linear regression analysis  where a regression line based on observations obtained in a sample describes this relation.</p>
<p>Hands-on exercises are worked out behind the PC using the R software.</p>

<h2>Target audience</h2>
<p>This course will benefit professionals and investigators from diverse areas  research scientists  clinical research associates  investing in data handling and wishing to acquire insight into basic statistical methods or to refresh their knowledge and practice of statistics.</p>
<h2>Fees</h2>
<p>The participation fee is 1320 EUR for participants from the private sector. Reduced prices apply to students and staff from non-profit  social profit  and government organizations. An exam fee of 35 EUR will be applied.</p>
<ul><li>Industry  private sector  profession*: <strong>€ 1320</strong></li><li>Non profit  government  higher education staff: <strong>€ 990</strong></li><li>(Doctoral) students  unemployed: <strong>€ 595</strong></li></ul><p>*If two or more employees from the same company enrol simultaneously for this course a reduction of 20% on the course fee is taken into account starting from the second enrolment.</p>

            <p>Huge amounts of data are available today for biomedical research. These data arise in different forms like images  omics-data  electronic medical files  etc. Machine Learning algorithms can help researchers to find patterns  classify the data or help to make well-founded decisions  based on these data. Typical examples are the analysis of CT scans for cancer diagnoses or the identification of the proper treatment for MS patients.</p>

<p><em>7 December 2023 - 13h-15h<br></em>Through machine learning  AI systems can learn and reproduce patterns of human intuition in datasets on a large scale. However  human behaviour in high-impact decision-making has always come with ethical codes and expectations  especially in biomedical sciences. Now that AI systems play an increasingly substantial role in such decisions  they should also aim to meet ethical standards. In this module  we particularly consider the ethical principles of fairness and privacy in AI systems  both highly active fields of research. Fairness aims to avoid statistical patterns of discrimination in decision-making  such as performing far worse for certain demographic groups.

            <h4>Abstract of the lecture<br> </h4>
<p>The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) entails enormous ethical challenges. Especially  we do not fully understand how ethical perceptions about AI influence both job applicants and the organizations that use AI for hiring purposes. In this session  we will discuss important aspects of using AI in hiring processes. First  we will discuss that AI is not created equally in terms of ethical perceptions. Indeed  people view the use of AI differently depending on what aspects of the hiring process it is used for (e.g.  analyzing CV vs. analyzing one’s social media). Then  we will discuss the influence of ethical perceptions of AI in hiring on the trust individuals put in organizations that use AI in hiring.</p>
<p>We will focus on the importance individuals lend to AI performing its expected role  and how this expectation influences their ethical perceptions of AI  and in turn the trust they put on organizations using AI in hiring. Finally  we will further discuss whether and how ethical perceptions of using AI in hiring are related to individuals’ attraction to organizations that use AI in hiring. Circling back to the beginning of the session  we will discuss that the influence of ethical perceptions of using AI in hiring are not consistent across hiring methods. For example  only individuals who consider it ethical for organizations to use AI in intrusive ways  such as analyzing social media information for traits and characteristics  viewed such organizations as more attractive.</p>

		This course introduces the use of the R environment for the implementation of data management  data exploration  basic statistical analysis and automation of procedures.
	
                            <h2>Description</h2>
<p>R is a flexible environment for statistical computing and graphics  which is becoming increasingly popular as a tool to get insight in often complex data. While in some ways similar to other programming languages (such as C  Java and Perl)  R is particularly suited for data analysis because ready-made functions are available for a wide variety of statistical (classical statistical tests  linear and nonlinear modeling  timeseries analysis  classification  clustering  ...) and graphical techniques.</p>
<p>The base R program can be extended with user-submitted packages  which means new techniques are often implemented in R before being available in other software. This is one of the reasons why R is becoming the de facto standard in certain fields such as bioinformatics (Bioconductor) and financial services.</p>
<p>This course introduces the use of the R environment for the implementation of data management  data exploration  basic statistical analysis and automation of procedures.</p>
<p>It starts with a description of the R GUI  the use of the command line and an overview of basic data structures. The application of standard procedures to import data or to export results to external files will be illustrated.</p>
<p>Creation of new variables  subsetting  merging and stacking of data sets will be covered in the data management section. Exploration of the data by histograms  box plots  scatter plots  summary numbers  correlation coefficients and cross-tabulations will be performed.</p>
<p><strong>Simple statistical procedures that will be covered are:</strong></p>
<ul><li>comparisons of observed group means (t-test  ANOVA and their non-parametric versions) and proportions</li><li>test for independence in 2-way cross tables and linear regression (focusing on the R-implementation of the statistical methods that are the subject of other modules of the statistics series)</li></ul><p>Finally  installing new packages and automation of analysis procedures will also be discussed.</p>
<p>Practical sessions and specific exercises will be provided to allow participants to practice their R skills in interaction with the teacher.</p>

<h2>Target audience</h2>
<p>This course targets professionals and investigators from diverse areas with little to no R-programming experience who wish to start using R for their data manipulation  data exploration or statistical analysis.</p>
<h2>Fees</h2>
<p>The participation fee is 620 EUR for participants from the private sector. Reduced prices apply to students and staff from non-profit  social profit  and government organizations.</p>
<ul><li>Industry  private sector  profession*: <strong>€</strong> <strong>620</strong></li><li>Non profit  government  higher education staff: <strong>€ 465</strong></li><li>(Doctoral) students  unemployed: <strong>€ 280</strong></li></ul><p>*If two or more employees from the same company enrol simultaneously for this course a reduction of 20% on the course fee is taken into account starting from the second enrolment.</p>

            <p>The social and economic impact of generative AI systems is likely to be major in many potential uses  for example in the environment or in healthcare. However  these generative AI systems raise many ethical  epistemological  anthropological  psychological  economic  social  political and cultural questions. Some of these issues will continue to occur as these technologies are put to new uses  and it is not yet possible to predict all the effects they will have on individuals and society.</p>
<p>Since the end of 2022  economic and political actors in several countries are discussing the impact of language models built with these generative AI systems. Some of these models have an impressive number of parameters. The race for the largest model is ongoing  but it is not certain that larger models would deliver higher performance.</p>
<p>Laurence Devillers was involved as a co-writer of the opinion n°7 of the ethical issues of generative artificial intelligence in the CNPEN (National Pilot Committee for Digital Ethics). In this opinion  CNPEN focuses on the most important ethical issues in the light of current experience with generative AI systems  mainly on language models.</p>

            <p>The name “Bohemian matrices” was proposed for a field that has actually been studied for many years now by different researchers  not recognizing their commonality. The name comes from an acronym for BOunded HEight Matrices  of Integers  although the restriction to integers has been subsequently relaxed. The “height” of a vector is its infinity norm  and the “height” of a matrix A is the infinity norm of vec(A). The word “height” has been commonly used in the context of univariate polynomials expressed in the monomial basis: the height of a polynomial is the infinity norm of the vector of coefficients. We say “characteristic height” for the height of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix A.</p>
<p>The idea is to restrict the study to families of matrices all of whose entries come from a finite (and hence bounded) set  called the population. Well-known examples include zero-one or binary matrices  Bernoulli matrices whose entries are either 1 or -1  and sign pattern matrices where the entries can be 1  0  or -1. One can then study Bohemian families of structured matrices  say upper Hessenberg Toeplitz Bohemian matrices  or complex symmetric tridiagonal Bohemian matrices  or symmetric matrices with entries from a restricted population  or Bohemian companion matrices  or other families.</p>
<p>In this talk I will survey some known results  and discuss some problems that remain open. In particular  I will ask for help in finding algorithms to construct “minimal height” companion matrices for polynomials with integer coefficients; such things exist (possibly not uniquely) but there is no known good algorithm for constructing them. I will give examples where the height of the companion matrix is exponentially smaller (in the degree/dimension) than is the characteristic height. This seems interesting because lower height offers the hope of better eigenvalue conditioning. But even that is not well-understood.</p>
<p>This is joint work with many people.</p>

<p>September 20-22: Orthogonal Design of Experiments (by Eric Schoen)</p>
<p>The Summer School will start with a thorough introduction of the theory of optimal experimental design  for models ranging from the simple linear regression model to multiple linear regression models and nonlinear regression models. Next  the focus will shift to orthogonal experimental designs which are especially useful for screening experiments. These are experiments involving many factors and relatively small numbers of observations.</p>

            <p>The world becomes more urbanized. Over 56% of the world population now lives in cities  and this number can go as high as 97% in Belgium. In parallel  technology plays an increasingly important role in these environments. Specifically: Artificial intelligence  Data  and Robotics have become an integral part of living in cities. We may not always be aware of their presence  but they are playing a critical role in our daily commutes  government services  local stores  or in the public space.</p>
<p>Concepts such as ""smart cities"" have emerged and reflect the continuing desire of cities to implement these technologies on a large scale to address local challenges - one of which is  of course  becoming even more sustainable. AI and data are now being actively used in a variety of areas  from energy sharing to biodiversity monitoring. Despite these hopes  growing concerns have emerged about the overall inhibiting impact of these technologies on sustainability. In addition  ethical and legal concerns have emerged  to the point where cities enact local responsible use principles  also insisting on greater citizen inclusion.</p>
<p>This conference will investigate if and how AI  Data  and Robotics  can become local and are truly sustainable for cities.</p>
        
            <p>The FARI Brussels Conference agenda is continuously being updated and improved to give you the best and most insightful conference experience. We will release the final program and presentation titles weeks before September 11  but here's a sneak peak of what is cooking!</p>

The programme's goal is to offer participants the latest insights on AI from various perspectives, and in particular the fields of law, ethics and policy.</p>|"
            <p>In 2021  KU Leuven organised the first edition of its Summer School on the Law  Ethics and Policy of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Given the programme's overwhelming success  a third edition will be taking place in September 2023.<br></p>

<p>The lectures are provided by renowned academics  policy-makers from EU and international institutions as well as practitioners  allowing participants to grasp not only the theoretical but also the practical implications of the use of AI in these fields. </p>
<p>The Summer School's intended audience concerns postgraduate students who already obtained a master's degree and junior/senior researchers from various disciplines  as well as policy analysts  lawyers and legal experts  civil servants  members of civil society organisations  AI practitioners  and other professionals with an interest in broadening their understanding of AI and its impact on society. </p>
<p>Participants receive a certificate of attendance with the equivalence of 3 ECTS credits. Those interested also have an opportunity to share their research with fellow participants through a research presentation session. </p>
<p>The Summer School is intended to take place as a hybrid event  enabling participants to join both <em>on campus</em> and <em>online</em>. </p>

            <h2>MONDAY | Introduction and Digital Scholarly Editing<br></h2>
<p><em>Digital Scholarly editing  theory and practice  HTR  XML</em></p>
<p>We will start the week with the theoretical background of digital scholarly editing and handwritten text recognition.</p>
<h3>TUESDAY | Handwritten Text Recognition</h3>
<p><em>Transkribus  TEI-XML</em></p>
<p>On the second day  we will recap what we have learned about HTR  and we will focus more specifically on the workflow in Transkribus. Then  we will do a creative exercise: writing a short story by hand. This will be the material to work with during the day as we will run the HTR model to 'transcribe' your own handwriting. In the end  we will export the results in TEI-XML.<br></p>
<h3>WEDNESDAY | Keystroke Logging</h3>
<p><em>Inputlog  keystroke logging  TEI-XML</em></p>
<p>On the third day  we will build upon the creative exercise of Tuesday: we will revise the short story on the computer and logging the writing process with a keystroke logger. We will then use these keystroke logging files to learn the basic technologies involved in making a (genetic) digital edition. As a first step  we will encode all the textual operations (e.g.  new text production  additions  deletions) in TEI-XML together with the timestamps of each operation. These XML files will be used the next day as we move on to the visualisation of the reconstructions of the digital writing processes.<br></p>
<h3>THURSDAY | eXist-db</h3>
<p><em>eXist-db app  HTML  CSS</em></p>
<p>On the fourth day  we will learn the basics of working with eXist-db. After jointly installing eXist-db  we will use a pre-made eXist-db application  which can visualise the keystroke logging transcription. In the afternoon we will visit a museum.</p>
<h3>FRIDAY | Visualising Manuscripts and Born-Digital Writing Processes</h3>

            <p>During the last years  Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have gained a great importance in several research domains and applications that can learn from data. Thus  one can use DNN for image processing  actions recognition  text classification  language processing  speech recognition  etc. However  this high success of DNN models is accompanied by a high increase of computation time  architecture complexity  and memory storage. Moreover  the deployment and exploitation of DNN models in real environments is generally related to connected sensors (cameras  microphones  temperature sensors  etc.) where the inference process needs to be executed in real time on embedded or edge resources. In this work  we present an overview of the three main compression methods (pruning  quantization  knowledge distillation) that allow to reduce the computation time and memory size of DNN models while keeping a high accuracy. Experimental results are conducted within image classification  object detection and actions recognition with DNN models that were optimized and deployed on Edge AI resources such as Jetson Nano  Jetson Xavier and Jetson Orin. The obtained results showed that we could reach a compression factor of around 6x while keeping a good accuracy  and we also observe a speedup of 3x compared to non-compressed models.<br></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">We consider a problem of optimizing macro-averaged complex performance metrics in multi-label classification  that is metrics linearly decomposable into a sum of binary classification utilities applied separately to each label. We focus on tasks in which the algorithm is required to predict exactly k labels for each instance  leading to macro-at-k metrics. The constraint couples the otherwise independent binary classification tasks  leading to a much more challenging optimization problem than standard macro-averages. We analyze the problem in two different statistical regimes  namely in the expected test utility (ETU) and the population utility (PU) frameworks. The former aims at optimizing the expected performance on a given test set  while the latter optimizes the performance on a population level. For both frameworks we derive optimal prediction rules and practical algorithmic solutions with provable statistical guarantees. Empirical results provide evidence for the competitive performance of the proposed approaches.<br></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Due to the steadily increasing relevance of machine learning for practical applications  many of which are coming with safety requirements  the notion of uncertainty has received increasing attention in machine learning research in the recent past. This talk will address questions and challenges regarding the representation and adequate handling of (predictive) uncertainty in (supervised) machine learning. A specific focus will be put on the distinction between two important types of uncertainty  often referred to as aleatoric and epistemic. In this regard  a recent generalisation of the common (empirical) loss minimisation approach in machine learning will be critically anaysed and shown to be fundamentally flawed.</p>

Tias Guns — KU Leuven  Belgium)</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Industry and society are increasingly automating processes  which requires solving combinatorial optimisation problems. To find not just optimal solutions  but also 'desirable' solutions for the end user  it is increasingly important to offer AI tools that automatically learn from the user and the environment and that support the constraint modelling in interpretable ways. In this talk I will provide an overview of three different ways in which AI can augment the modeling part of combinatorial optimisation. This includes learning from the user (preference learning in VRP)  learning from the environment (end-to-end decision focussed learning) and explanation generation  that sit at the intersection of learning and reasoning. As part of this work  we are building a modern constraint programming language called CPMpy(http://cpmpy.readthedocs.io) that eases integration of multiple constraint solving paradigms with machine learning and other scientific python libraries. I will shortly highlight its possibilities beyond the above cases  as well as our larger vision of conversational human-aware technology for optimisation.</p>

Thomas Mortier </strong><strong>—</strong> <strong>Ghent University</strong><strong>) </strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In recent years  the use of machine learning has gained popularity in solving complex tasks across multiple domains  including robotics  healthcare  biology and finance. However  with the increasing amount of data and complexity of tasks  the notion of uncertainty has become of major importance in machine learning. The ability to represent uncertainty in an efficient and trustworthy way should therefore be considered as a key feature of any machine learning method. This thesis aims to address this challenge by focusing on the development of principled tools to efficiently represent uncertainty in machine learning. In particular  the concept of set-valued prediction is highlighted  which provides end-users with multiple answers instead of a single answer with little guarantee. To this end  probabilistic classification is considered  where the unknown relationship between inputs and classes is assumed to be non-deterministic and expressed by a conditional class distribution. A distinction between several settings in classification is made and different biological applications are considered  including large-scale bacterial species identification using Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) data.</p>

            <h4>Post-pandemic world</h4>
<p>In the post-pandemic world  employees want the flexibility to choose where – and when – they work. Research suggests a large majority of workers would turn down a job that did not offer a flexible work schedule. Flexible or ‘hybrid’ work models make employees feel more empowered and organizations are responding. The pandemic also highlighted another significant fact: Giving employees the freedom and autonomy for more flexible working environments doesn’t lead to reduced productivity or poor-quality work.</p><h4>Hybrid work</h4>

<p>In the new world of hybrid work  employee experiences are quickly becoming a key measurement for success. It’s not just about offering the flexibility to work from anywhere  it’s about empowering employees with the right tools and information to do their job well and removing the barriers that cause friction  which often leads to frustrated and unhappy employees.</p>
<p>By removing information barriers and simplifying complex processes through technology  you can deliver employee experiences that allow your workforce to focus on the things that matter  like impactful customer interactions  innovative thinking  and future business growth.</p>
        
            <h4><strong>Session 1: </strong><strong>DELIVERING EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCES THAT EMPOWER THEIR WORKFORCE AND ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENT</strong></h4>
<p>Massive generational shifts  increasingly international teams as well as a desire for more hybrid working are forcing most organizations to adapt their work strategies. Organizations need to develop balanced models focused on increased content collaboration through secure enterprise content management to access information from any location and embrace the future of work. At the same time  employees demand increasing social responsibility from their employers as well as an active involvement in the development of inclusive and sustainable strategies.Through practical examples and best practices  this session will address how to set up management processes designed for how we get things done today. Flexible team collaboration requires both clear ownership and the breaking down of information silos. There is a need to improve communication  collaboration  and clarity across the organization – while facilitating access anywhere  anytime in a safe and secure way</p>
<h4><strong>Session 2: BOOSTING OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY BY REDUCING DIGITAL FRICTION AND INCREASING AGILITY</strong></h4>
<p>Operational excellence can be achieved through collaborative  integrated content experiences that include intelligent automation and data insights as well as end-to-end information management.</p>
<p>This session will provide a framework on setting up meaningful conversations with your team on the possibilities assistive technology software (OATs) could provide. This will allow you to work out an ’employee journey’ that gives a picture of daily tasks and activities  together with the opportunities and preconditions for OATs from employees’ experiences and opinions. The aim is to look not only at the impact of OAT at the level of the employee  but also of a team and the organisation. What changes to the working situation (terms of employment  working conditions  labour relations and job content) could an OAT cause?<br></p>
<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<h4><strong>Session 3: IMPROVING INFORMATION PROTECTION AND GOVERNANCE</strong></h4>
<p>Undefined and unmitigated risks are still pain points for organizations  as they continue to operate without clear  consistent  easily accessed information. This session will provide a primer of the most important concepts and a first exercise to identify GDPR vulnerabilities.</p>

            <p>In recent years  deep learning models have resulted in outstanding breakthrough performances. However  many models behave as black boxes that can hide data biases  incorrect hypotheses or even software errors. In this talk  Maria Rodriguez Martinez (IBM Zürich) illustrates how interpretable deep learning models can achieve both high prediction accuracy and transparency.</p>
<p>First  she will introduce multi-modal deep learning models that predict drug response while highlighting the genetic and chemical patterns that were more informative to make a prediction. Rodriguez Martinez also discusses how reinforcement learning approaches can facilitate the early phases of drug discovery and support the personalized design of new candidate compounds.</p>
<p>Focusing next on T cell-based immunotherapies  she presents a model to predict the binding of T cell receptors and epitopes. This model can be coupled with an easy-to-use interpretable pipeline to extract the binding rules governing the T cell binding. These approaches are a first step towards the design and engineering of receptors of improved affinity.</p>

These concerns imply many responsibilities, opportunities for action, and frustrations for different stakeholders. Computer scientists and other academically-educated professionals (i.e., “us” as the presenters and audience of this talk) form one, or even several, of these stakeholder groups. How can we have a principled discussion about our responsibilities?|"
            <p>After an introductory example  in this talk  we will look into professional ethics codes for guidance  and ask how to make principled choices regarding the values that are often alluded to only loosely in these codes. We then focus on the value of reducing inequalities and avoiding discrimination. We take a critical look at 'de-biasing'  a term for an evolving set of computational methods that have received a lot of attention as potential answers to AI challenges from within the AI community. We open the discussion to explore how researchers’ action spaces can be enriched through interdisciplinary collaboration. We also ask how this focus on individual responsibilities can and must be complemented by structural adjustments. Last but not least  we aim at furthering participation opportunities through technology by organising this talk as a hybrid live event.</p>

		<p>Since their earliest conception in the 1940s  artificial neural networks have been alternatively regarded as extremely promising machine learning models  capable of learning anything  and as glorified linear combinations  unable to achieve relevant results in practice.<br></p>
<p>However  along the last decade  the availability of general-purpose GPU architectures and large quantities of data has enabled the rise of deep neural networks  which have attained state-of-the-art performance in many applications  from image classification to text translation. This has given rise to a whole new field of research  ranging from generative models to adversarial attacks (and defenses against them).</p>

            <p>Dynamical models play a key role in many branches of science. In engineering they have a paramount role in model-based simulation  health monitoring  control and optimization. The accuracy of the models is often crucial to their subsequent use in model-based operations.</p>
<p>Data-driven modeling (system identification) and statistical parameter estimation are established fields for determining mathematical models of dynamical systems on the basis of measurement data from dedicated experiments.</p>
<p>The 5-days Spring School aims at covering the fundamentals of data-driven modeling approaches (ranging from parameter estimation algorithms (PEM and ETFE) and experiment design to model validation) as well as more advanced topics. In this year edition  these advanced topics will pertain to closed-loop identification  to optimal experiment design and to the use of statistical tools (such as the maximum likelihood theory) for learning the dynamics of linear and nonlinear systems. </p>

		<p>The AI Act is based on  and at the same time aims to protect fundamental rights  implying their protection  while fulfilling the safety requirement prescribed by the AI Act within the whole lifecycle of AI systems. Based on a risk classification  the AI Act provides a set of requirements that each risk class must meet in order for AI to be legitimately offered on the EU market and be considered safe. However  despite their classification  some minimal risk AI systems may still be prone to cause risks to fundamental rights and user safety  and therefore require attention. In this keynote we explore the assumption that despite the fact that the AI Act can find broad ex litteris coverage  the significance of this applicability is limited.</p>

            <p>In this course  we review different combinatorial optimisation problems (Vehicle Routing  Scheduling and combinatorial puzzles) as well as discrete optimisation techniques for solving them  including Branch and Bound  Integer Programming  Dynamic Programming and Multi-Valued Decision Diagrams  Constraint Programming  Local Search and Hybridization of the aforementioned techniques. A focus will be on the reusability and genericity of the techniques for solving large classes of constrained optimisation problems.<br></p>
<p>With a better understanding of the solving techniques  we then move 
to the second part of the course which focuses on ‘Predict and Optimize’
 problems  where part of the input to the combinatorial optimisation 
problem has to be inferred from data. We will review issues such as 
perception-based solving (e.g. visual sudoku)  learning preferences in 
vehicle routing and end-to-end learning for energy-aware scheduling. We 
will discuss how to improve either the learning or the solving  as well 
as the integration of the two to obtain the best results.<br></p>

            <p>Often robotics and artificial intelligence are seen as the same. But many robots do not use artificial intelligence algorithms for the control of their behaviour. Their control is dependent on known models  and  based on these models  calculations and input data  a complex algorithm defines the output and hence the behaviour of the robot.</p>
<p>‍However  as such the system cannot learn. Artificial intelligence systems provide robotics application new impressive perspectives  but also come with complex challenges. For aspects like vision and speech recognition  deep learning has drastically outperformed traditional methods. These approaches typically require massive amounts of labelled data and computational power. Although data is typically abundant in robotics  labelling is sparse and expensive. For the control of robots  reinforcement learning often requires significantly more iterations than are feasible on real systems.‍</p>
<p>Therefore  a lot of the learning work is done in virtual environments  with challenges to transfer to the real world. Moreover  robots are interacting with the real world and challenges exist how to learn in a safe way  for the humans  for the environment and for the robot itself. ‍</p>
<p>Both methods  model-based control and learning methods  have disadvantages and advantages  and combining the best of both worlds is probably an interesting solution. Moreover like in animals and humans  due to millions years of evolution  the bodies are optimized for the tasks and the environment. Through a smart design with the use of new materials  actuators and sensor  part of the computational intelligence can be outsourced to the embodied intelligence of the robot body.‍</p>
<p>According to the paradox of Moravec “AI can quickly learn to perform tasks considered ""difficult"" by humans”  such as complex statistics and analysis. However  on the other hand  tasks that are trivial for humans  are often still exceedingly difficult for computers and robots.” Therefore instead of replacing humans by robots  there has been a lot of focus on developing collaborative robots to exploit these complementary strengths.</p>

		<p>Language makes infinite use of finite means  as Chomsky would have it. There is an interesting functional similitude between Chomsky’s generative grammars and the latest generative language models such as ChatGPT. They both generate language; they are able  broadly speaking  to convert an idea into various wordings  within the bounds of what is grammatical. They differ as well: Chomsky’s economizing principles stand in stark contrast with the careless ‘maximalism’ of Large Language Models  fueled by the motto “there’s no data like more data”. How do these models relate to each other  and also with respect to an important third model  the human language system  implemented in countless independent brains? Drawing on linguistic  computational and neurobiological research I discuss how these different views offer explanations for individual language variation  by focusing on the building bricks  the ‘finite means’  they appear to be using.</p>

<p>Sleep stage classification is a fundamental step in sleep assessment to diagnose sleep-wake disturbances. It requires the analysis of 30-second segments of electroencephalography (EEG) data to determine the corresponding sleep stage. In clinical environments  sleep staging is mainly performed manually by medical experts following developed guidelines. The procedure is time-consuming  labor-intensive and prone to human error. In recent years  deep learning methods have managed to achieve close-to-human performances in sleep staging  with the goal of automating this task. However  today  these methods are not yet being adopted in clinical practice. In this talk  we will address the challenges that stand between automated sleep staging methods and clinical practice and discuss methods we have researched to tackle these.</p>

<p>The analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data often presents a unique challenge as it is not possible to track individual cells over time. Instead of this temporal information  usually only a snapshot of cells within a tissue is available. In order to gain insight into the development of biological processes  trajectory inference methods were developed to order these cells along a pseudotemporal axis representing a continuous developmental process. In this talk  I will discuss the particular challenges associated with using this type of data  the prevalent ways in which this data is analysed and highlight ongoing research efforts in expanding these methods to accommodate multiple samples and more complex biological processes.</p>

<p>Suffering from hearing loss has a large implication on your social life. Even with modern hearing aids  it is still very difficult for a hearing impaired person to take part in a conversation when a lot of other people are talking in the background. Tragically  these situations also tend to be when communication is the most key; think of family gatherings  receptions  meeting with friends... Hearing aids fail in such scenarios because they don't know to whom the user wishes to listen and thus don't know which speaker to enhance. Instead  they become unstable  enhance the wrong speaker and eventually  most users are forced to switch off their hearing aid  effectively isolating them from the conversation. A promising solution to this problem is to decode from from detected brain activity to which speaker the user wishes to listen  called <em>auditory attention decoding</em> (AAD). The idea is to measure the electrical activity of specific regions of the brain using miniature concealed devices  and then use this data to predict who the attended speaker is using several signal processing techniques. In this talk  I will explain the core ideas behind AAD  show how some key signal processing techniques can be used and provide an intuitive understanding why brain decoding is possible.</p>

            <ul><li><strong>14h: Benoît Macq </strong>-<strong> ""Coalitional Active Learning""</strong></li></ul><p>Many recent reports and articles show a big gap between the successful achievements of deep learning and their adoption in clinical practice. We propose a new implementation paradigm to overcome this gap.<br>Practitioners are committed to continuing medical education for their accreditation. They provide annotations and second advice in informal coalitions. These coalitions are also the place for continuing medical education. We propose Coalitional Active Learning  which takes labels provided by the coalition instead of those only provided by individual hospitals  as in classical federated learning approaches. This will align the members on common best clinical practices and increase transfer knowledge between hospitals.</p>
<p>Coalitional Active Learning will provide a continuously joint improvement of the accuracy of the model and of the human expertise. It is based on active learning  which relies on a parsimonious label harvesting on the most informative cases. For those cases  the data will go through an optimal sampler to the coalition. Experts will then provide labels and this will be used to make the clinical decision and to update the model. The labelling process increases the level of expertise of the practitioner who did the labelling. Coalitional active learning optimises this co-learning under the constraint of time-budgets.<br><br>We propose two veins to reach this goal. One based on an analytical approach by defining a coalitional gain and the related optimum sampling in the coalition and one based on stochastic scheduling. We will also propose a new secure multicast of image data in a coalition across hospitals with guarantees of ephemeral use of the data. Tokenisation and anonymity of the labels are essential for the acceptance by the practitioners.</p>
<ul><li><strong>15h15: Christine Decaestecker - ""Deep learning from multi-expert annotations: need for prior consensus or not? A use case in prostate cancer classification""</strong></li></ul><p>Deep learning algorithms rely on large amounts of annotations for the training and validation stages. In the medical image domain  the ""ground truth"" is rarely available and disagreements between experts affect many segmentation and classification tasks. Often  consensus annotations are produced as ""ground truth"" for training and performance evaluation. This talk presents a use case in digital pathology (prostate cancer grading) where taking into account the annotations of each expert can be beneficial for learning and interpreting results  while being more consistent with the complex clinical reality.</p>
<ul><li><strong>16h: Roald Sieberath - A perspective on: Foundation models and ChatGPT</strong></li></ul><p>ChatGPT has garnered an incredible amount of interest from a very broad public. Its perceived intelligibility has led some to believe it marks the beginning of Artificial General Intelligence  while others have pointed out its numerous errors and limitations. GPT-3 is one of many ""large language models "" such as OPT  Sparrow  PaLM  and Bloom  that have been referred to as ""foundation models"" in a <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07258.pdf"" tabindex=""-1"">seminal paper</a> by Stanford HAI. These models provide a broad base of capabilities  and a new type of platform upon which extensions can be built  e.g. through fine-tuning or few-shot learning. They also suffer from many drawbacks  such as typically lacking a representation of the world  leading to errors  in turn raising many ethical  transparency  and security concerns. Moreover  because building a new foundation model requires tremendous computing power (tens of thousands of GPUs)  they will likely be controlled by a few well-funded players  further raising the need for transparency. Going beyond just the scientific aspects  Roald Sieberath will draw upon his experience as an entrepreneur in data  trained in venture capital and in AI in Silicon Valley  to offer a perspective on why we need a large-scale  open-source  european effort to devise foundation models that warrant the level of trust that our citizen and companies expect.</p>

A deep dive into reinforcement learning|https://www.vaia.be/en/courses/a-deep-dive-into-reinforcement-learning|6/02/2023|Course-Brussels-VAIA &amp; Flames|6 Feb 2023 10:00 - 15:00|English|VUB, campus Etterbeek, Pleinlaan 2, Brussel|Target audience: onderzoekers||Python compiler installed, Basic knowledge of statistics, probability theory|free|https://www.flames-statistics.com/iu-courses/64/|Using reinforcement learning to solve challenging real world problems|<p>Reinforcement learning is no longer limited to games, as many real-world problems can be formulated as a reinforcement learning problem. Recent studies used reinforcement learning to solve challenging problems such as wind farm control, epidemic mitigation, and robot control.</p>|"
            <p>Reinforcement learning concerns a distinct branch in the field of machine learning. While supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques learn based on a set of instances  reinforcement learning concerns an agent that learns by interacting with an environment. To illustrate this setting  consider a video game  where the agent identifies as the player of the game. The environment concerns the video game that can be controlled with a gamepad and observed by looking at the screen. The agent receives feedback from the environment in terms of rewards  for example via a game score. Based on this feedback and the observations of the environment  a reinforcement learning agent aims at learning to play the game optimally  by interacting repeatedly with the environment. In this course  we will study both the reinforcement learning problem and the algorithms that can be used to approach such problems.</p>
<p>Over the last years  several important milestones were achieved using the reinforcement learning framework  such as learning to play ATARI 2600 video games  learning to play the board game Go to beat the number one human player and learning to reach grandmaster performance in the real-time strategy game Starcraft II. However  reinforcement learning is no longer limited to games  as many real-world problems can be formulated as a reinforcement learning problem. Recent studies used reinforcement learning to solve challenging problems such as wind farm control  epidemic mitigation  and robot control.</p>
<p>In this course  we will convey the fundamentals that underlie reinforcement learning. To achieve this  we will start from intuition and applications to move towards formalisms that can implement a reinforcement learning agent. To move from formalisms to practice  we will explore these concepts in a grid-world environment using the python programming language.</p>

            <p>Modern day decision-making and control systems are required to operate with increasing levels of autonomy and under highly uncertain conditions. This brings about the need for advanced planning and control strategies that are able to learn from online observations  while still adhering to strict requirements on safety  reliability and real-time capabilities  common in more traditional control applications. To this end  many approaches are emerging  differing in their underlying assumptions on sources of uncertainty and methodologies for learning.</p>

            <p>In 2012  AlexNet [Krizhevsky et al.  NeurIPS'12] shook the field with the remarkable performance it obtained on the task of image recognition at a large scale. This showed the potential of artificial neural networks  and deep models in general  for modeling visual data. At the same time  this motivated the adoption of deep models by both academia and industry to the point of making these models the standard when building AI systems for visual data.<br>Despite their high predictive performance  follow up work showed that the complex structure that characterize these models obscures what characteristics or features of the training data are internally encoded in the model (Interpretation). At the same time  it is hard to assess what characteristics from a given input are considered by the model when making a prediction for such input.</p>

            <p>Physical dynamic systems like mechatronic systems face increasing challenges with respect to efficiency and quality. Higher levels of adaptivity and automation are required in an industry 4.0 setting. Control strategies based on expert knowledge and physics-based models are often suboptimal as not all physical phenomena might be properly incorporated. Also  the interactions of physical dynamic systems with varying environments bring about uncertainties. Reinforcement learning agents on the other hand allow to learn from interactions but demand expensive and sometime unsafe experimentation.</p>

            <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) deals with the interactions between
 humans and machines and establishes the link between computers and 
natural language. The idea is that the computer is able to process and 
understand language data  both written text and speech. The aim is to 
accurately digest the information in language and text  without losing 
the nuances and context.</p>
<h4>Learning outcomes</h4>
<p>Participants:</p>
<ul><li>have a better understanding of the use of AI on language data.</li><li>gain insight into the underlying language models used in speech and text analysis.</li><li>gain insight into existing tools and applications.</li></ul>
        
            <p>NLP has a wide range of possible applications and is used in all 
sectors to make work easier. The benefits speak for themselves. 
Computers operate 24/7  do not make mistakes due to fatigue or 
distraction  and can process large amounts of information in no time.</p>
<p>The technology is in constant evolution and more and more becomes 
possible in subdomains such as text recognition (also in less obvious 
cases such as recognition of handwritten texts  or formatted text that 
is part of a complex layout)  text categorization  automatic speech 
recognition and detection and analysis of sentiment and emotions.</p>
<p>Participants can register for <strong>each course separately</strong>.
 All courses have a theoretical component dealing with the possibilities
 and developments in the domain  as well as an optional hands-on session
 in which participants can gain (a first) hands-on experience with 
existing tools.<br></p>

<p>Conventional approaches in times series literature are restricted to low-dimension series  linear methods and short horizons. Big data revolution is instead shifting the focus to problems (e.g. issued from the IoT technology) characterized by very large dimension  nonlinearity and long forecasting horizon. The presentation will discuss a number of settings where machine learning approaches may be used to deal with time series forecasting and causal understanding. The first part will focus on machine learning strategies for one-step-ahead and multi-step-ahead forecasting both in univariate and multivariate tasks. In particular we will discuss MIMO strategies for multi-step-ahead forecasting of univariate time series and DFML  a machine learning version of the Dynamic Factor Model (DFM)  a successful forecasting methodology well-known in econometrics.</p>
<p>The DFML strategy is based on a out-of-sample selection of the nonlinear forecaster  the number of latent components and the multi-step-ahead strategy. While accurate forecasting may be obtained by learning associative dependencies between different time instants and time series  an open challenge is how to discriminate between associative dependencies and effective causal relationships. This is particularly challenging in large-variate temporal settings (e.g. spatio-temporal time series) where the multivariate nature of interactions induces a significant correlation between most of the variables. The second part of the presentation will discuss how supervised classification techniques may be used to identify causal dependencies in time series once a proper set of context-dependent descriptors are introduced. The approach  called D2C (Dependency to Causality) performs three steps to predict the existence of a directed causal link between two variables in a multivariate setting: (i) it estimates the Markov Blankets of the two variables of interest and ranks its components in terms of their causal nature  (ii) it computes a number of asymmetric descriptors and (iii) it learns a classifier (e.g. a Random Forest) returning the probability of a causal link given the descriptors value.</p>

<p>The advent of complex high-quality autonomous AI systems raises a number of questions on how these systems should decide and act when released into the wild without (or with minimal) human supervision. To avoid disasters  either exogenous (regulations) or endogenous (design) solutions are being proposed. Essentially both solutions want to ensure that the use of AI in business and society is able to align both individual and social preferences and norms  without causing a negative disruption.</p>
<p> In this seminar  I will show that evolutionary game theory  a theoretical framework for studying multi-agent interactions and learning  and related behavioural experiments can help achieve this ambition. Central to this ambition is our ongoing work on studying mechanisms that may influence a collective of agents to prefer cooperation in the context of competitive situations  where individual and collective preferences are not be aligned. I will start this seminar with a short introduction to evolutionary game theory and then zoom in on some cases where we will use both simulations and human experiments to understand how cooperation or coordination can be improved.</p>
<p>What sets EGT apart from other learning paradigms to explore this cooperative AI question is that it immediately combines both individual and societal effects in one framework. It is this duality that needs to be incorporated into the study of cooperative AI systems in order to achieve intelligent systems that are aligned with both an individual’s preferences and norms as well as those of society as a whole.</p>

            <p>The behavioral approach to systems theory  put forward 40 years ago by Jan C. Willems  remained till recently an esoteric niche of research. The renewed interest in the last years is because of its unique suitability for the newly emerged data-driven paradigm  specifically the representation-free perspective on dynamical systems as sets of trajectories. A result derived in the behavioral setting that became known as the fundamental lemma started a new class of subspace-type data-driven methods. The fundamental lemma gives conditions for a non-parametric representation of a linear time-invariant system by the image of a Hankel matrix constructed from raw time series data. This course reviews the fundamental lemma  its generalizations  and related data-driven analysis  signal processing  and control methods. A prototypical signal processing problem considered in the course is interpolation and approximation of trajectories. It includes simulation  state estimation  and output tracking control as special cases. The theory leads to computationally tractable methods. Regularized version of the methods is robust to noise and model assumptions. Participants will get hands-on experience with the methods via Matlab exercises and individual work on mini-projects.</p>
        
            <p>The course consists of six 2.5-hour sessions. A session starts with an introduction  followed by questions-and-answers and exercises. After the third session  students will choose mini-projects to work on.</p>
<p>The course will not cover a fixed curriculum and will be adapted as much as possible to the need and interests of the participants. An indicative outline of topics that will be discussed in the course is:</p>

Therefore it's important to apply some measures on the data to reduce the risk of disclosing sensitive information as much as possible. In this course we focus on the techniques in Statistical disclosure control to minimize the amount of personal data in data sets.</p>|"
            <p>Legitimacy of data-driven research and success of data-intensive applications depend on protecting privacy in the design  realisation  deployment and maintenance of these studies and systems. Personal Data Minimization (PDM) is a core principle of privacy protection  whereby the amount of personal data in data sets is adjusted to the level needed for the legitimate data usage in mind (i.e.  for the aimed study or system functionality). Mainly  Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) tools and mechanisms are used for the PDM of micro and tabular data sets. SDC technology aims at mitigating the disclosure of privacy sensitive information to adversaries who have access to the content of such data sets. Applying SDC methods is necessary before storing the data sets  sharing them with scientific community or partner organisations  or opening them to the public. Using a SDC tool  an expert can apply advanced SDC algorithms with proper parameters to a data set (i.e.  transform the data set)  gain insights into the utility of the original and the transformed data sets  estimate the data disclosure risks of the original and the transformed data sets  and eventually make appropriate trade-offs between the indicators of data utility and data disclosure risks.</p>
<p>The task of applying SDC into practice  however  increasingly becomes difficult due to the growth of data volume  variety  velocity ... and the availability of background information to adversaries. Data growth makes it difficult to detect potential privacy issues hidden in data sets (relating to the intrinsic characteristics of data sets) and background information makes it difficult to assess the potential risks when combining sensitive data sets with other ones (relating to the extrinsic characteristics of data sets).</p>

Although these systems generally produce outstanding results, they are also imperfect, just like human beings. While the added value of these systems is that they are able to match or exceed human performance in a way that is both faster and cheaper, a fundamental challenge remains that it is impossible to rule out occasional incorrect results.<br></p>|"
            <p>Consequently 
the legal relevance of AI systems is growing rapidly  especially when these
systems are used to support a party in the process of contract formation. This
seminar focuses on four applications in which parties may consider an AI
system’s analysis in the decision (not) to conclude a contract. To begin with 
AI systems are increasingly being used to support due diligence in M&amp;A
transactions. In an HR context  these systems are relied upon to analyse
resumes or employee performance. AI systems are used as a contracting tool in
the banking and insurance sector as well  e.g. to quickly assess the situation
and work out an appropriate settlement that the other party is likely to
accept. Finally  these systems can also be used in the art sector to assess the
authenticity of a piece of art.</p>
<p>These applications can help support the work of lawyers and
in-house counsel. However  because AI systems are not flawless  they can also
give rise to disputes. The resolution of such disputes depends on the difficult
assessment of whether a party was entitled to rely on the AI system in given
situation  and on the identification of the relevant legal regime. To facilitate
this analysis  lawyers  company lawyers and judges may benefit from a basic
understanding of the advantages and legal challenges of the use of AI systems
to support contract formation  which will be discussed during this seminar.</p>

<p>We review different challenges and opportunities for traffic control 
in railway systems. From the point of view of sensing  state estimation 
and data fusion must be performed in a very short time  and for units 
that are typically spatially dispersed. From the point of view of 
determining a control objective to support automatic decisions  the 
challenge is how to understand the impact of a decision in terms of 
system performance. Almost all of those problems have to deal with 
unknown future states  which must be predicted  typically by model-based
 or black box approaches  also based on advanced analytics. Once an 
objective function and optimization variables are determined  
optimization models can help to find a solution quickly and effectively.
 Further challenges are the acceptance of decision stakeholders  within 
the control room  but also within the travelers and operators  or the 
direct implementation of automatic digital control. For 
passenger-oriented traffic control  this is particularly interesting and
 challenging  due to the large amount of possible decisions per decision
 maker  and data that can partially describe those aspects  which calls 
for machine learning approaches. To reach all those goals  the system 
must have room for control  in another sense  flexibility in operations 
must be built in already from the planning  to be exploited in the 
real-time horizon when needed.</p>

<p>Digitisation and employee workload (im)balance are intertwined. To <strong>address undesirable workload peaks and lows</strong>  we propose a <strong>2-step machine learning model to provide </strong><strong>real-time workload analytics per controller in digital safety-critical control rooms</strong>. The advocated model leverages a rich real-time data structure with disaggregated event-level taskload data. Next to exploring different machine and deep learning approaches  we compare the performance of a model that predicts aggregate workload with the performance of the aggregate of different models that predict specific task loads. We develop a <strong>business application</strong> that utilizes the proposed model to provide detailed predictive analytics that <strong>open the black box of workload imbalance</strong> and  in this way  empowers the control room manager with real-time insights.</p>

<p>The Decision Making Process is already associated with AI. The algorithms are meant to help ATCOs in daily tasks  but they still face acceptability issues. Today’s automation systems with AI/Machine Learning do not provide additional information on top of the Data Processing result to support its explanation  making them not transparent enough. The Decision Making Process is expected to become a “White Box”  giving understandable outcome through an understandable process. <u>XAI SOLUTIONS: Transparency and Explainability:</u> ARTIMATION’s goal is providing a <strong><em>transparent and explainable AI model</em></strong> through <strong><em>visualization  data driven storytelling and immersive analytics</em></strong>. This project will take advantage of human perceptual capabilities to better understand AI algorithm with appropriated data visualization as a support for explainable AI  exploring in the ATM field the use of immersive analytics to display information.</p>

<p>Modern systems are complex and understanding the nuances of everyday work requires to explore thoroughly system properties. EUROCONTROL recognized these needs when publishing its white papers on Resilience Engineering almost 15 years ago. The project called “Weak Signal” continued on that side. Besides the theoretical foundation on weak signals definition  detection and management  one of this project’s outputs is the development of a novel tool called <em>SECA</em> (Structured Exploration of Complex Adaptations). SECA helps detecting weak signals in normal air traffic management operations  creating shared organizational knowledge. This latter arises from a collaborative elicitation process that span from tacit and explicit dimensions. SECA is designed to <em>support </em>data gathering and data analysis  integrating traditional thematic analyses with modern <em>Natural Language Processing</em>. The presentation will show the early results of its adoption in two different European ANSPs and the way to scale it up from a prototype to a full-fledged solution  also including the possibility to use the same approach in other industries.<br></p>

            <p>This summer school provides a comprehensive overview of the various legal  ethical and policy-related issues around AI and algorithm-driven processes more broadly. As these technologies have a growing impact on all domains of our lives  it becomes increasingly important to map  understand and assess the challenges and opportunities they raise. This requires an interdisciplinary approach  which is why we are collaborating across faculties and departments to organise this Summer School. The programme's goal is to offer participants the latest insights on AI from various perspectives  and in particular the fields of law  ethics and policy.</p>
<p>The lectures are provided by renowned academics  policy-makers from EU and international institutions as well as practitioners  allowing participants to grasp not only the theoretical but also the practical implications of the use of AI in these fields.</p>

Computer Says D’Oh!|https://www.vaia.be/en/courses/computer-says-doh|6/09/2022|Guest Lecture-Leuven-KU Leuven|6 Sept 2022 14:00 - 15:00|English|Room C++, 05.01, Celestijnenlaan 200A, Heverlee|Target audience: Computer- en AI-wetenschappers die met taal bezig zijn|06 Sept 2022||Free||"Bridging the Gap Between “Funny Peculiar” and “Funny Ha-Ha"""|<p>During this guest Lecture, Prof. Tony Veale will explore some of the ways in which a machine can leverage its sense of the “funny peculiar” to foster a sense of “funny ha-ha” in human audiences. He will look at different formal strategies for framing the peculiar as the funny, as in the automated generation of stories, and outline a data-driven, social application of these ideas to show how an imperfect machine sense of humour might achieve useful results at scale while still struggling to tell the amusing from the unusual.</p>|"
            <p>There are  broadly speaking  two ways of using the word “funny” in English. The first  which relates to situations that puzzle but do not amuse  is “funny peculiar ” as when we find our car keys in the fridge or questionable charges on our phone bill. This is the sense to which Isaac Asimov alludes in his observation that “The most important words in science are not ‘Eureka’ but ‘that’s funny.’” The second relates to the sense of humour  to amusing situations that make us laugh  often because they have been deliberately engineered by others to do precisely that. </p>
<p>It turns out that computers excel at the first sense of “funny ” both at fostering a puzzling sense of the peculiar in their users and at recognizing user behaviours that are statistically out of the ordinary  but stumble rather badly on the second. The fact that we use “funny” to describe these very different kinds of experience suggests that both share a common grounding in the incongruous  but a formal and/or algorithmic means of converting “funny peculiar” into “funny ha-ha” has proven stubbornly elusive to humour theorists and computationalists alike. The gulf between the two is most easily bridged in the case of the pun – the form of humour on which machines have shown the most success to date – since pun-words themselves serve as a shallow bridge between multiple words and senses. But machines still find it acutely difficult to look beyond the pun  to see intention in the peculiarities of others or to imbue their own creations with comical intent. However  just as one person’s funny peculiar is another’s funny ha-ha  machines can mine the large grey area between the two in ways that make their efforts at humour more than accidental if still less than entirely knowing and deliberate.</p>

            <p>Human processes of all kinds are complex and adaptive. Mental  social  and health-related processes can all change and adapt over time with human behaviour. Thought-based processes can change as a result of learning  social interactions can evolve over time  and health-related processes are susceptible to change too.<br><br>This course will present theories and findings from a wide range of disciplines  including various branches of cognitive  social  health and neuroscience  to gain insight into underlying mechanisms of human processes that can be exploited in human AI modeling and simulation. The various scientific theories form a factual basis for modelling the processes. We can understand these often adaptive mechanisms through causal relations and causal pathways  which we can model as networks. Using this theoretical framework and the software provided  students can easily simulate a variety of scenarios.<br><br>During the second week  students will carry out activities that could lay the foundations for a publication that can be finished later on in the course.This course introduces a network-oriented modelling approach based on adaptive networks. This approach is useful for modelling social interactions and mental and health-related processes within their respective networks.<br><br>These network models cover the dynamics of causal effects  changing causal connections and excitability or sensitivity thresholds. Higher-order adaptiveness is another topic covered in the course  which includes the role of metaplasticity and the extent to which plasticity occurs in the field of cognitive neuroscience.<br><br>Assessment is based on the assignments. In the second week of the course  a final assignment is addressed  which might be worked out to a paper that may be submitted to an international conference  where it could be presented and provided a publication. For this  support is provided also after the course.</p>

            <p>In December 2017  Carnegie Mellon poker playing computer Libratus has stunned the world by winning 1.7M in a 20 days tournament against four poker stars.</p>
<p>In a nutshell  Libratus is a decision-making agent that takes decisions in an uncertain environment  exploring the potential consequences of their own choices using complex estimates of the world around.</p>
<p>This course is a study of the basic building blocks of decision-making agents  which are abstract entities living in an uncertain environment and are guided towards the realisation of given objectives.</p>
<p>An agent is typically endowed with a knowledge base  a collection of facts expressed in some logical language  and an action repertoire at each state. The agent can reason about the environment  using their knowledge base  and take decisions accordingly. The environment is typically unknown  stochastic  and evolves following some rules that might be unknown to the agent  as well. On top of this  it is usually inhabited by other agents  which may or may not strive to achieve similar objectives. The task is to take the best possible decision that can be taken given the (incomplete) information available.</p>
<p>This simple model is the basis of a number of important achievements in AI  and combines the use of logical  game-theoretic and algorithmic analysis.<br></p>

Identifying the input or innovation process in a non-parametric way, while modeling the dynamics in a parametric way leads to a semi-parametric time series model.</p>|"
            <p>Non-parametric methods in time series are well known. Schuster's periodogram was applied in 1898 to disprove Knott's hypothesis that earthquakes are a periodic phenomenon  while later it was used to analyse the periodicity of Sunspots. Nonetheless  such non-parametric periodogram based methods are typically considered an exploratory tool to understand the dynamics present in time series data. In that paradigm  such a non-parametric analysis can be used as a preparatory step towards a parametric model building within the Autoregressive(-Integrated) Moving Average (ARIMA) framework.<br><br>Time series analysis is somewhat complementary to system identification where the most important difference is the experimental design and the proceeding data analysis. In system identification  one has access to the input and output time series whereas in time series analysis only the output time series is measurable such that the input time series is typically denoted as the innovation process. A natural question that arises in time series is: can we reconstruct the input signal in a non-parametric way? Identifying the input or innovation process in a non-parametric way  while modeling the dynamics in a parametric way leads to a semi-parametric time series model.<br><br>In this lecture  we will explore this question. A reconstruction in the strict sense is not possible however we will see that by virtue of Wold's decomposition theorem a proxy of the innovations driving the time series can be built. Furthermore  we check the scenarios where one should prefer such a semi-parametric time series model. It is particularly advantageous when the innovation process exhibits non-stationarities while the dynamics remain time-invariant. This aspect will be illustrated by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

First  we will review the basic theoretical background from convex analysis needed to understand proximal-based methods  including subgradients  conjugate functions and proximal operators. Then  in the central part of the course  we will explore several algorithms  including proximal gradient  dual proximal gradient  acceleration techniques  smoothing approaches  block decomposition variants and various splitting methods  including Lagrangian-based methods. The theoretical emphasis will be on the complexity results. On the applied side  implementation issues and applications will be discussed.</p>

            <p>Data Science and Artificial Intelligence techniques impose challenging demands on the quality of data that are often characterised by huge  integrated or connected volumes and a large variety of data formats. Trusted and explainable data are of vital importance for the success of applications. Legal requirements even put extra challenges in view of data protection and non-discrimination. With this event  we share experiences on data quality handling from the Flanders AI Research Program and provide networking opportunities for (potential) actors in this program.</p>

 dive into the concept ‘AI’ where you will learn what is considered 
artificial intelligence and what not. He will give an overview of the 
field and talk about some current trends. As director of lifelong

            <p>In this session we go into depth on the data based algorithms called 
machine and deep learning techniques. Prof. dr. Dirk Valkenborg 
(UHasselt) will show different kinds of algorithms like supervised and 
unsupervised learning methods and discuss the basic terminology 
involved.

 and expertise on data integration and engineering  Tina and Marcel 
Parciak (UHasselt) discuss how you can scale up your health data by 
combining data from different repositories. Centralised and federated 
approaches might be possible but still need a common language. Therefore
 a common data model like OMOP can provide a solution. In this session 
we discuss the different challenges regarding these topics and give an

            <p>Police today increasingly rely on technologies of surveillance  data collection  inference  and prediction. These technologies include tools of collection  like body cameras and license plate readers  and the software to analyze that information  like video analytics and predictive policing. All of them share in common a reliance on artificial intelligence and enormous amounts of digitized data. We can refer to these tools broadly as “police surveillance technologies.” These police surveillance technologies pose significant legal and policy challenges that have outpaced many of the traditional methods of police regulation in the United States. This seminar offers a perspective on the diversity of regulatory and policy challenges  including questions of accountability  transparency  and private sector influence that exist because of the enormous market for these technologies.</p>

            <p>Many of our current technological systems are composed of subsystems that have local dynamic behaviour and that interact with each other in a network structure. Typical examples are found in e.g.  power systems (smart grids)  biological systems  flexible mechanical structures  robotic networks  transportation systems and distribution networks.</p>
<p>For control  optimization and diagnostics of those systems  the interconnected nature leads to distributed and/or multi-agent type of approaches  while data is playing a paramount role in modelling  monitoring and controlling the dynamic behaviour of the system.</p>
<p>In this seminar we will present the emerging challenge of developing effective and scalable tools for data-driven dynamic model learning in large-scale interconnected systems  also referred to as dynamic networks. Focusing on linear dynamic networks  the problems of conceptual network modelling and local module learning will be presented  while graph-based tools are shown to be able to address problems like sensor and excitation/actuator allocation for accurately learning either a single module or a full network.</p>

            <p>Regulating AI is high on the European policy agenda. The proposed AI Act classifies the application of AI in employment and management as a high-risk area  due to their potential impact on “career prospects and livelihoods of workers” by “perpetuating historical patterns of discrimination”. However  recent expositions of algorithmic management in warehouses and online platforms show that concerns about AI in the workplace should extend beyond career prospects and livelihoods into job quality and worker wellbeing. In this paper  we review the existing evidence on AI’s potential effects – both positive and negative – on current job quality trends  using Eurofound’s seven-dimensional job quality framework.</p>

            <p>The models are characterized by primal and dual model representations  expressed by feature maps and kernel functions  respectively. It enables to tailor model representations to given data and system characteristics  such as the number of training data and dimension of the input space. Duality principles also provide new connections and synergies between neural networks  deep learning and kernel machines. We discuss modelling of dynamical systems for different input-output and state space model structures. Applications will be<br>shown on electricity load forecasting and temperature prediction in weather forecasting. Kernel spectral clustering for time-series will be illustrated on identifying customer profiles and pollution modelling.</p>

            <p>We introduce a new task  unsupervised vision-language (VL) grammar induction. Given an image-caption pair  the goal is to extract a shared hierarchical structure for both image and language simultaneously. We argue that such structured output  grounded in both modalities  is a clear step towards the high-level understanding of multimodal information. Besides challenges existing in conventional visually grounded grammar induction tasks  VL grammar induction requires a model to capture contextual semantics and perform a fine-grained alignment. To address these challenges  we propose a novel method  CLIORA  which constructs a shared vision-language constituency tree structure with context-dependent semantics for all possible phrases in different levels of the tree. It computes a matching score between each constituent and image region  trained via contrastive learning. It integrates two levels of fusion  namely at feature-level and at score-level  so as to allow fine-grained alignment. We introduce a new evaluation metric for VL grammar induction  CCRA  and show a 3.3% improvement over a strong baseline on Flickr30k Entities. We also evaluate our model via two derived tasks  i.e.  language grammar induction and phrase grounding  and improve over the state-of-the-art for both.</p>

            <p>In recent years  we have seen significant steps taken in the development of self-driving cars. Multiple companies are starting to roll out impressive systems that work in a variety of settings. These systems can sometimes give the impression that full self-driving is just around the corner and that we would soon build cars without even a steering wheel. The increase in the level of autonomy and control given to an AI provides an opportunity for new modes of human-vehicle interaction. However  surveys have shown that giving more control to an AI in self-driving cars is accompanied by a degree of uneasiness by passengers. In an attempt to alleviate this issue  recent works have taken a natural language-oriented approach by allowing the passenger to give commands that refer to specific objects in the visual scene. Nevertheless  this is only half the task as the car should also understand the physical destination of the command  which is what we focus on in this paper. We propose an extension in which we annotate the 3D destination that the car needs to reach after executing the given command and evaluate multiple different baselines on predicting this destination location. Additionally  we introduce a model that outperforms the prior works adapted for this particular setting.</p>

            <h4>1 : Introduction (4 April 10-13h)</h4>
<p>This module is an overall course introduction  sketching all the facets and aspects of securing a system or service in general  and of a data driven application based on ML in particular. Each of the major course modules will be briefly introduced and motivated.</p>
<h4>2 : Security &amp; Privacy (S&amp;P) Engineering and Regulations (4 April  14-17.30h)</h4>
<h6><em><strong>Module 2A</strong></em></h6>
<p>The covering of S&amp;P requirements is a matter of running a significant security project  albeit efficiently. There is no such thing as <em>the</em> ultimate approach  but rather a range of measures and activities that can be applied to strengthen the S&amp;P posture. This can be at the level of requirements and specification  at the level of coding  in security testing  etc. This module will cover the overall landscape and zoom into some of the most promising techniques.</p>
<p>Relevant themes of this session include:</p>
<ul><li>Threat modelling and risk assessment</li><li>Architectures and blueprints</li><li>Regulations and compliance</li></ul><h6><em><strong>Module 2B</strong></em></h6>
<p>Security and privacy requirements are typically not only of a technical nature  they also and largely emerge from the demand to be compliant with policies and regulations. In the second module of <em>Security &amp; Privacy Engineering</em>  we zoom into the most relevant regulations and discuss how we can work towards compliance. In addition  we discuss how this concern can be addressed as an integrated part of the overall development and engineering process.Z</p>
<h4>3 : Cryptography: basic &amp; advanced techniques (5 April  10-13h)</h4>
<p>Many protection techniques and technologies are at hand. It goes without saying that cryptography is an essential building block at the heart of data protection  and thus essential for the delivery of S&amp;P requirements. The machine learning pipeline needs protection of training data  production data and models. This challenging environment demands for fairly advanced techniques.</p>
<h6><strong><em>Module 3A</em></strong></h6>
<p>In the module <em>Cryptography I</em>  we revisit the basics of cryptography to make sure that all attendants can refresh their existing knowledge on the subject matter.</p>
<h6><strong><em>Module 3B</em></strong></h6>
<p>In the module <em>Advanced Cryptography and Data Protection</em>  we elaborate on the most recent advances and techniques that can contribute to securing advanced data sharing in distributed AI. Relevant themes of this session include:</p>
<ol><li>Data storage in the new century</li><li>Data processing: an overview of cryptographic protection<ol><li>MPC intro and applications</li><li>FHE state-of-the-art and implications</li></ol></li><li>Protection of data in motion</li></ol><h4>4 : Security and privacy posture of a Machine Learning architecture (5 April  14-17h)</h4>
<p>In this module  we revisit the architecture and operational environment of a machine learning application and analyze the values of contributions of known security techniques. Relevant themes of this session include:</p>
<ul><li>Attack surface: data  model  process and data flow</li><li>Threat modelling for AI and known challenges</li><li>Adversaries and their capabilities</li><li>Architectural and algorithmic defences</li><li>Security and privacy challenges in Federated Machine Learning</li></ul><h4>5 : Adversarial Machine Learning (6 April  14-17h)</h4>
<p>In this module  we zoom into the specific challenge of achieving robustness and reliability when facing adversaries that attempt to fool the ML application by feeding disturbing data into  e.g. a classifier. This type of attack is typical to the setting of a ML environment and deserves significant attention. Relevant themes of this session include:</p>
<ul><li>Vulnerabilities in ML systems; overview of ML specific attacks</li><li>Protection against adversarial examples</li><li>Evaluation and robustness of solutions</li><li>Privacy aspects</li></ul><h4>6 : Case Studies (7 April  10-13h)</h4>
<p>In this module  we discuss and analyze some case studies and apply the knowhow of this course to a specific application  for example in the context of authentication systems. Relevant themes of this session include:</p>
<ul><li>Face recognition revisited</li><li>Biometrics and challenges</li><li>Anomaly detection</li></ul><h4>7 : Workshops (7 April  14-17h &amp; 8 April  10-17h)</h4>
<p>In this module  we organize – if so desired – interactive workshops with smaller groups of attendants who may share an interest in a common application domain. The goal is to validate which elements of the course can be applied to an application domain or case that is well understood by a team of course attendants. The practical approach and organization of this last module will depend on the engagement and input that is provided by the participants.<br></p>

            <p>Dynamical models play a key role in many branches of science. In engineering they have a paramount role in model-based simulation  health monitoring  control and optimization. The accuracy of the models is often crucial to their subsequent use in model-based operations.</p>
<p>Data-driven modeling (system identification) and statistical parameter estimation are established fields for determining mathematical models of dynamical systems on the basis of measurement data from dedicated experiments.</p>
<p>The 5-days Spring School aims at covering the fundamentals of data-driven modeling approaches (ranging from parameter estimation algorithms (PEM and ETFE) and experiment design to model validation) as well as more advanced topics. In this year edition  these advanced topics will pertain to closed-loop identification  to optimal experiment design and to the use of statistical tools (such as the maximum likelihood theory) for learning the dynamics of linear and nonlinear systems. </p>

            <p>Acoustic signals are a rich source of information that have ample perspective to glean useful insights about the monitoring context. Furthermore  information can be collected at a distance from the acoustic sources without making physical contact. Deep learning models are typically used to automatically add semantics to the acoustics. However  such models typically are learned using a massive amount of input-output pairs  ignoring domain knowledge that additionally might be available. When domain knowledge is injected by customizing model architectures and/or constraining the learning mechanism  it is expected that the need for annotated data is relaxed. Furthermore  when the processing platform on which the models will be deployed is known beforehand learning can already take into account constraints that entail thresholds on computational and memory complexity. In this way the model deployment process can be smoothened. After explaining the research context some concrete use-cases will be discussed along with future work directions.</p>

            <p>Natural Language Processing  or NLP  is rapidly gaining popularity. 
It appears more and more in everyday life  most notably in the chatbots 
that assist you on online shops. Meanwhile  developers continue to 
struggle with the development of NLP applications because the algorithms
 learn from existing  historical texts and decisions which include 
mistakes. So how can they make the systems ‘fair’ if they don’t learn 
from fair input? And how can they ensure that analyses are neutral and 
unbiased if their source input consists of prejudiced content? In two 
half days Prof. Tim Van de Cruys (Dep. Linguistics) and Pieter Delobelle
 (Dep. Computer Science) from KU Leuven will teach you the most 
important techniques to recognize and avoid bias in NLP.</p>

            <p>Multi-view data analysis approaches are attracting more and more attention recently due to the increasing availability of multi-source data in real-world applications  e.g. continuous monitoring of the operation of industrial assets (wind turbines  compressors  …) in the field generates a vast amount of data originating from a multitude of very diverse sources (operating parameters  environmental conditions  …). However  it is <strong>not always feasible and neither wise to approach data analytics</strong> for such applications <strong>by merging all the available data into a single data set</strong>.</p>
<p>In order to conduct meaningful analytics on complex data <strong>one should be able to consider and analyse separately different data representations (or views) provided by the different sources</strong> and take full advantage of the extracted knowledge by <strong>applying an appropriate integration analysis</strong>. Multi-view data analysis algorithms aim to solve these challenges by respecting the latent structure of the different data views. Dr. Tsiporkova will demonstrate <strong>the potential of multi-view analysis on real-world data </strong>by illustrating how it can be <strong>used for the integration of heterogeneous temporal data originating from multiple sources</strong> and for the establishment of a direct link between the operating modes and the prototypical performance of an industrial asset.</p>

            <p>In recent years  AI and particularly machine learning have experienced a clear increase in interest from outside academia. The unprecedented performance of machine learning algorithms in solving complex tasks from a high volume of structured and unstructured data caught the attention of industry  governments  and society. The use of sub-symbolic ensembles or deep learning techniques led to this massive performance capacity in very specific tasks. However  the <strong>responsible use of machine learning has added another variable to this equation: the interpretability component.</strong> Multiple application domains exist in which predicting with high accuracy is not enough. For high-stakes decisions affecting humans  explaining why or how an intelligent algorithm made a decision or took action is also required.</p>

<p>Local city authorities have mountains of data  which only continue to grow as decisions are made on a monthly basis. This data overload makes it hard for city employees to quickly find and access the right information. At the same time  citizens have questions and expect quick responses from city personnel regarding topics from garbage disposal to parking and building regulations. This is extremely frustrating for both the city employees and the citizens. Nalantis' proprietary AI system uses natural language understanding to contextually understand City Council decisions in unstructured format (Text  Video and Audio) across multiple languages. The pre-trained NLU software extracts meaning from text through automatic semantic annotation at paragraph and sentence level.</p>

		<p>Tracking seizures is crucial for epilepsy monitoring and treatment evaluation. Current epilepsy care relies on caretaker or patient seizure diaries  but often many seizures are missed. Automated electroencephalography (EEG)-based seizure detection systems are a useful support tool to objectively detect and register seizures during long-term video-EEG recording. However  this standard full scalp-EEG recording setup is of limited use outside the hospital  and a discreet  wearable device is needed for capturing seizures in the home setting. Wearable devices may be better tolerated and more suitable for long-term ambulatory monitoring.<br></p>

(covariate-adjusted) Gaussian graphical models”</strong></p><p>A distributed estimation and statistical inference framework is introduced for the
sparse precision matrix in the (covariate-adjusted) Gaussian graphical models under the un-
balanced splitting setting. This type of splitting arises when the datasets from different sources
cannot be aggregated on one single machine or when the available machines are of different
powers. A de-biased estimator of the precision matrix on every single machine is proposed 
and theoretical guarantees are provided. Moreover  a new de-biased estimator that is pooled
across the machines using a composite likelihood approach is proposed. It is shown to enjoy
consistency and asymptotic normality  and we provide statistical inference strategies based on
it. The performance of this estimator is investigated via simulation studies and real data exam-
ples. It is shown that the performance of this estimator is close to the non-distributed estimator 
which uses the entire dataset.

without smoothing on the instruments”
</strong></p>
<p>We propose a new estimation method for nonparametric models identified by Instru-
mental Variables (IVs). The estimation is based on a class of Generically Comprehensively
Revealing functions. Compared to methods available in the literature that smooth on the IVs 
our estimation does not smooth on the instruments and thus requires the selection of less tun-
ing parameters. Furthermore  it does not suffer from a curse of dimensionality on the IVs. We
show that our procedure is equivalent to a classical estimation method that smooths on the Ivs
but keeps the bandwidth fixed as the sample size increases.
</p>
<p>We then extend our methodology to estimate a partly linear model with endogenous variables.
We obtain convergence rates for the estimator of the nonparametric part of the model and
the asymptotic normality of the estimator of the parametric components. To deal with the ill-
posedness of the inverse problem  we use a Landweber-Friedman regularization. This has the
advantage of being a simple iterative method that avoids the inversion of a large matrix whose
dimension increases with the sample size. We finally study the implementation of our proce-
dure and propose a data-driven selection of the regularization and the smoothing parameters.

model for mixed datasets”
</strong></p>
<p>Clustering mixed data presents numerous challenges inherent to the very heteroge-
neous nature of the variables. A clustering algorithm should be able  despite of this heterogene-
ity  to extract discriminant pieces of information from the variables in order to design groups. In
this work we introduce a multilayer architecture model-based clustering method called Mixed
Deep Gaussian Mixture Model (MDGMM) that can be viewed as an automatic way to merge
the clustering performed separately on continuous and non-continuous data. This architecture
is flexible and can be adapted to mixed as well as to continuous or non-continuous data. In this
sense we generalize Generalized Linear Latent Variable Models and Deep Gaussian Mixture
Models. We also design a new initialisation strategy and a data driven method that selects
the best specification of the model and the optimal number of clusters for a given dataset “on
the fly”. Besides  our model provides continuous low-dimensional representations of the data
which can be a useful tool to visualize mixed datasets. Finally  we validate the performance
of our approach comparing its results with state-of-the-art mixed data clustering models over
several commonly used datasets.</p><ul><li>12:00–1:00 pm</li><li>online</li></ul><p><em>10 March 2022</em> <strong>Cavit Pakel </strong>(Bilkent University) <strong>“Bounds on average effects in discrete choice panel
data models”
</strong></p>
<p>Average effects in discrete choice panel data models with individual-specific fixed
effects are generally only partially identified in short panels. While consistent estimation of
the identified set is possible  it generally requires very large sample sizes  especially when the
number of support points of the observed covariates is large  such as when the covariates
are continuous. In this paper  we propose estimating outer bounds on the identified set of
average effects. Our bounds are easy to construct  converge at the parametric rate  and are
computationally simple to obtain even in moderately large samples  independent of whether the
covariates are discrete or continuous. We also provide asymptotically valid confidence intervals
on the identified set. Simulation studies confirm that our approach works well and is informative
in finite samples. We also consider an application to labor force participation. (Joint work with

robust portfolio allocation problems as an application and study the impact of risk versus uncer-
tainty in a dynamic mean-variance setting. We show that a mean-variance optimizing investor
achieves economically meaningful wealth gains (33%) across our sample from 1996-2019 by

to a convex optimization problem which assumes a separable form across multiple learning

events”
</strong></p>
<p>Progression of chronic disease is often manifested by repeated occurrences of
disease-related events over time. Delineating the heterogeneity in the risk of such recurrent
events can provide valuable scientific insight for guiding customized disease management.
In this paper  we propose a new sensible measure of individual risk of recurrent events and
present a dynamic modeling framework thereof  which accounts for both observed covariates
and unobservable frailty. The proposed modeling requires no distributional specification of the
unobservable frailty  while permitting the exploration of dynamic effects of the observed covari-
ates. We develop estimation and inference procedures for the proposed model through a novel
adaptation of the principle of conditional score. The asymptotic properties of the proposed es-
timator  including the uniform consistency and weak convergence  are established. Extensive
simulation studies demonstrate satisfactory finite-sample performance of the proposed method.
We illustrate the practical utility of the new method via an application to a diabetes clinical trial
that explores the risk patterns of hypoglycemia in Type 2 diabetes patients. </p><ul><li>5:00–6:00 pm

</strong>(Universidad de Chile) <strong>“Endogeneity in discrete choice models”
</strong></p>

<p>Endogeneity is the most severe failure that a discrete choice model can face in its
objective of making causal inference or forecasting. It occurs when the explanatory variables
are not independent of the error term and results in inconsistent estimators of the model pa-
rameters. This seminar summarizes the causes  impact  and state of the art methods to detect
and to address endogeneity in discrete choice models  which are related  but differ in relevant
aspects  from those of linear model. The emphasis is put on providing the theoretical funda-
mentals and the intuition behind the problems that may arise  as well as practical details as
on how to apply the methods to address them  stressing the main considerations that must be
taken in this endeavor. The main concepts are formally stated  and references are given to
specific recent articles for further details that may be required for advanced applications or a
deeper understanding. The seminar begins providing details on the definition  impact  causes
and examples of endogeneity in discrete choice models  followed by a revision of possible
approaches to detect this problem. Then  a deep review of the fundamentals  intuition and
practicalities of the various methods that can be used to address endogeneity is presented 
followed by a section providing insights and methods related to the obtention and validation of
instrumental variables  which are key in this effort. The seminar continues then revising the
problem of forecasting with discrete choice models that have been corrected for endogeneity 
finalizing with a summary of the main conclusions and takeaways. <br></p><ul><li>5:00–6:00 pm</li><li>online</li></ul><p><em>28 April 2022</em> <strong>Cécile Adam

<p>Among the main interests in regression analysis is to explore the influence that a
functional has on a real-valued variable of interest  the response. There is some literature on
flexible mean regression  in which the targeted quantity is the conditional mean of the response
given the functional. Another interest in statistics is to study the regression under the condition
of censoring in which the values of the response are only partially known. After an introduc-
tion to mean regression function estimation in which the response variable is subject to right
random censorship  different statistical methodology are presented. The finite-sample perfor-
mance of the estimators is investigated via a simulation study. (Joint work with I. Gijbels and G.

<p>We investigate the problem of endogeneity in the context of hybrid choice (integrated
choice and latent variable) models. We first provide a thorough analysis of potential causes
of endogeneity and propose a working taxonomy. We demonstrate that although it is widely
believed that the hybrid choice framework is devoid of the endogeneity problem  there is no
theoretical reason to expect that this is the case. We then demonstrate empirically that the
problem exists in the hybrid choice framework too. By conducting a Monte Carlo experiment 
we display the extent of the bias resulting from measurement and endogeneity biases. Finally 
we propose two novel solutions to address the problem: by explicitly accounting for correlation
between structural and discrete choice component error terms (or with random parameters
in a utility function)  or by introducing additional latent variables. Using simulated data  we
demonstrate that these approaches work as expected  that is  they result in unbiased estimates
of all model parameters. </p><ul><li>12:00–1:00 pm </li><li>online</li></ul><p><em>12 May 2022</em> <strong>Wendun Wang

and also the characteristics of other units (spillover effects). The effect of own characteristics
can be unit-specific or homogeneous (common effects). We allow the spillover structure  i.e. 
which units interact with which  to be latent  and the structure and effect of spillovers may both
vary over time. We model time-varying spillovers via structural breaks with unknown break
points. To estimate the break points  spillover and common effects  we solve a penalized least
squares optimization and employ double machine learning procedures to improve the conver-
gence and inference. We establish the super consistency of the estimated break point and
provide the convergence rate of estimated spillover and common effects. We illustrate the

Second  I will discuss some of the work we have done in terms of analyzing sensor data about runners. Third  I will overview our work on analyzing time series arising from professional football matches</p>

            <p>How can you tell the difference between elephants and lions? We  humans  will know for sure when we encounter one in the wild  but machines can nowadays make an excellent guess too. <strong>With more than 99.5% accuracy  modern machine learning algorithms know very well how to exploit visual features as best as possible. </strong>But  alas  that is not the complete picture: <strong>machines are easily fooled too. </strong>With some clever tricks  any picture of a lion can easily be manipulated in such a way that humans do not notice any difference  but that the machine learning model sees a completely different animal. Such a <strong>manipulated image is called an adversarial example.</strong><br><strong>What is going on there? Have we built the most powerful machine learning models ever on brittle foundations? </strong></p>
<p><strong>The above is an example of adversarial learning </strong> a subfield of machine learning that is concerned with <strong>what happens when we fool a machine learning model and how we can prevent and/or exploit this.</strong> While the first example here is mostly concerned with issues  an example of exploitation is found in the class of machine learning models called <strong>generative adversarial networks</strong>. Ever since the dawn of generative adversarial networks  the field of generative machine learning has taken multiple leaps forward and has paved the way to application domains we couldn’t even think of before. When <strong>training generative adversarial networks</strong>  we let two machines play a game against each other: one machine gradually tries to become a master painter  while the other machine is the art critic that gets better and better at discerning genuine paintings from counterfeits. By making the painter try to fool the critic over and over again  the painter becomes more skilled and will produce more realistic paintings.</p>

            <p>The EU is moving ahead with a whole series of regulatory initiatives in the area of data governance  algorithms and artificial intelligence. In the discussions about these topics and initiatives  relevant technologies are often approached in an abstract  self-standing manner. What then can remain in the background are the specific ways in which these technologies and related organizational practices end up in our world in the first place  as well as the way in which this impacts the way in which effective regulation can be operationalized. Building on his paper with dr. Guerses <a href=""https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9gy73/"" tabindex=""-1"">‘Privacy after the Agile Turn’</a> and what Julie Cohen has called ‘<a href=""https://din-online.info/pdf/th20-1-3.pdf"" tabindex=""-1"">Turning Privacy Inside Out’</a>  this talk will look at the conditions for protecting fundamental rights in relation to data-intensive services and information systems. To make this turn  it is necessary to look at the particular ways and logics of production of services and information systems that are shaped by larger trends like the emergence of cloud and mobile computing and the platform economy and the particular challenges and opportunities of protecting fundamental rights in these environments.</p>

            <p>Giubilini and Savulescu (2018) define humans as “suboptimal 
information processors.” Due to stress  time constraints and limited 
mental capabilities  we do not always take into account all the relevant
 information necessary to arrive at a well-considered moral judgment. 
Moreover  <strong>we often act inconsistently</strong>. To make up for these shortcomings  they propose<strong> to be assisted by AI in moral decision-making</strong>. Unlike humans  AI can collect  analyze and process huge amounts of data in a very short period of time.</p>
<p>To what extent is it realistic that AI will assist our moral judgment in the future? Katleen Gabriels discusses <strong>different types of Artificial Moral Agents (AMAs) and the technical  conceptual and ethical challenges </strong>of moral judgments made by AI.<br></p>

            <p>We live in a time when information about most of our movements and 
actions is collected and stored in real-time. The availability of 
large-scale behavioral data dramatically increases our capacity to 
understand and potentially affect the behavior of individuals and 
collectives.</p>
<p>The use of this data  however  raises legitimate privacy concerns. 
Anonymization is meant to address these concerns: allowing data to be 
fully used while preserving individuals’ privacy. In this talk  Prof. de
 Montjoye will first discuss how traditional data protection mechanisms 
fail to protect people’s privacy in the age of big data. More 
specifically  he will show how the mere absence of obvious identifiers 
such as name or phone number or the addition of noise are not enough to 
prevent re-identification. Second  de Montjoye will describe what he 
sees as a necessary evolution of the notion of data anonymization 
towards an anonymous use of data. He will then conclude by discussing 
some of the modern privacy engineering techniques currently developed to
 allow large-scale behavioral data to be used while giving individual 
strong privacy guarantees.<br></p>
