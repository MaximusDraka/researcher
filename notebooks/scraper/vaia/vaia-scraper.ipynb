For each of these  the practical use of a set of standard methods will be shown  like Random Forests  Gradient Boosting Machines  Support Vector Machines  k-Nearest-Neighbors  K-means ... Furthermore  throughout the course  concepts will be highlighted that are of concern in every statistical learning applications  like the curse of dimensionality  model capacity  overfitting and regularization  and practical strategies will be offered to deal with them  introducing techniques such as the Lasso and ridge regression  cross-validation  bagging and boosting. Instructions will also be given on a selection of specific techniques that are often of interest  such as modern visualization of high-dimensional data  model calibration  outlier detection using isolation forests  explanation of black-box models ...

To investigate alerts generated by their SIEM system more thoroughly  they turn to a Network Protocol Analyzer (NPA). An NPA captures  analyzes  and visualizes network traffic and can have a broad range of applications.However  the procedures and configurations of NPAs vary according to the specific issue at hand (cybersecurity  troubleshooting  etc.)  which often leads to incorrect or inefficient usage in practice. During this workshop  we will build the knowledge and skills necessary to use Network Protocol Analyzers correctly and efficiently  particularly in the context of cybersecurity threats.

Our tools primarily rely on the theory of Khovanskii bases  combined with toric geometry.I will demonstrate the application of this approach to the problem of counting the number of approximate stationary states for coupled Duffing oscillators. We have derived a Khovanskii basis for the corresponding polynomial system and determined the number of its complex solutions for an arbitrary degree of nonlinearity in the Duffing equation and an arbitrary number of oscillators.

      "                            <p>Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a general statistical modeling technique to study the relationships among observed and latent variables. It spans a wide range of multivariate methods including path analysis  mediation analysis  confirmatory factor analysis  growth curve modeling  and many more. Many applications of SEM can be found in the social  economic  behavioral and health sciences  but the technology is increasingly used in disciplines like biology  neuroscience and operation research. SEM is often used to test theories or hypotheses that can be represented by a path diagram. In a path diagram  observed variables are depicted by boxes  while latent variables (hypothetical constructs measured by multiple indicators) are depicted by circles. Hypothesized (possibly causal) effects among these variables are represented by single-headed arrows. If you had ever found yourself drawing a path diagram in order to get a better overview of the complex interrelations among some key variables in your data  this course is for you.<br></p>\n",
      "<p>The first day of the course provides an introduction to the theory and application of structural equation modeling  and illustrates how to use the open-source R package `lavaan’ (see <a href=\"https://lavaan.org\" tabindex=\"-1\">https://lavaan.org</a>) to conduct an SEM analysis. On the second day  we discuss several special topics that are often needed by applied users (handling missing data  nonnormal data  categorical data  longitudinal data  multilevel data  etc.). With the exception of a short practical session at the end of the first day  the two days are mostly lectures  to maximize the amount of information that we can teach. However  do-it-yourself practicals (with written feedback and solutions) will be made available and illustrate all the topics that are covered in this course.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Target audience</h2>\n",
      "<p>This course targets everyone with an interest in testing theories or models that involve relationships between both observed and latent variables. The audience for this course can include both novices with little or no previous experience with SEM  as well as existing users who wish to refresh or update their theoretical and practical understanding of structural equation modeling.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Fees</h2>\n",

The formal basis is a predictive modelling framework called IDyOM (Pearce  2005) which finds statistical patterns in multi-dimensional sequence data. Information theoretic measures are used to segment sequences into perceptual or cognitive units which then form the basis of a knowledge representation. One application of this method is in modelling music cognition  which involves the real-time organisation of low-level stimuli  such as notes  into high-level structures  such as chords and phrases. A second application is in reinforcement learning. Partial observability  dynamic environments  hidden rewards and explainability are problems for RL models. Supervised learning incorporating knowledge about sub-tasks can mitigate these problems. Harley will describe how statistical modelling of agent behaviour sequences can be used to learn sub-task knowledge in an unsupervised manner.

A prominent example for this is the satisfiability problem in propositional logic (SAT)  an NP-hard problem that not only lies at the foundations of computer science  but also plays a key role in many real-world applications  notably in ensuring the correctness of hard- and software. In this presentation  Holger Hoos argues that it is time to rethink the way we assess the state of the art in solving problems such as SAT and the incentives for improving it. Hoos demonstrates how automated algorithm selection and configuration techniques based on sophisticated machine learning and optimisation methods have fundamentally changed not only the state of the art in solving SAT and many other NP-hard problems  but also provide a natural basis for cooperative competition - a new approach for achieving and assessing progress not merely in solving these problems  but also in the way we approach them as a scientific community.</p>\n",

      "            <p>Medicine has a distinct set of moral responsibilities. This is because the physician-patient relationship contains inherent inequalities of knowledge  skills  and control of resources  and it treats matters both intimate and potentially of great importance to the patient (Rhodes 2001; Nickel &amp; Frank 2020). These responsibilities include physician’s obligation to earn trust and be trustworthy (Rhodes 2001; 2020). The field of psychiatric medicine faces additional ethical challenges specifically related to patient trust. As artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies (in diagnosis  relapse prevention  and treatment) begin to play a larger role in all medicine  and specifically psychiatry  these ethical challenges may be exacerbated or complicated. In this talk I present three of these challenges relating to patient testimony  false empowerment  and harm prevention.</p>\n",

      "\t\n",
      "                            <p>Linear regression addresses how a continuous dependent variable is associated by one or more predictors of any type. The fact that many practical problems deal with continuous outcomes (e.g. income  blood pressure  temperature  affect) makes linear regression a popular tool  and most of us will be familiar with the concept of drawing a line through a cloud of data points.<br></p>\n",
      "<p>The first two sessions of this module introduce the conceptual framework of this method using the simple case of a single predictor. Formulas and technicalities are kept to a minimum and the main focus is on interpretation of results and assessing model validity. This includes confidence statements on the predictor effect (hypothesis tests and confidence intervals)  using the regression model to predict future results and verification of model assumptions.</p>\n",
      "<p>In session 3 and 4 we allow for more than one predictor leading to the multiple linear regression model. We focus on either explanation or prediction. How to come to a parsimonious model starting from a large number of predictors will be discussed in detail. In these complex linear models special attention will be given to interpreting individual predictor effects  as they critically depend on other terms in the model and underlying relations between predictors (confounding).</p>\n",
      "<p>In the last session a more elaborate data analysis is discussed. We touch on problems where linear regression is not appropriate and replaced by related approaches such as generalized linear models and mixed models.</p>\n",
      "<p>Different features will be illustrated with case examples from the instructors practical experience  and participants are encouraged to bring examples from their own work.</p>\n",
      "<p>Hands-on exercises are worked out behind the PC using the R software.</p>\n",

However  describing these decisions in a standardized format such as DMN is a time-consuming task  as various textual sources need to be analyzed. In this talk  we present the results of our experiments on an automated approach to generating decision tables from natural language based on the GPT-3 LLM. Through a total of 72 experiments over six problem descriptions  we evaluated GPT-3’s decision logic modeling and reasoning capabilities. While GPT-3 demonstrates promising abilities in extracting decision context and identifying relevant variables from natural language  further enhancements are needed to improve its decision table capabilities for efficient automation of DMN modeling.</p>\n",

Multivariate statistical methods may be used  but for often the dimensionality of the data set is much larger than the number of (biological) samples. Modern advances in statistical data analyses allow for the appropriate analysis of such data. Methods for the analysis of high dimensional data rely heavily on multivariate statistical methods. Therefore a large part of the course content is devoted to multivariate methods  but with a focus on high dimensional settings and issues. Multivariate statistical analysis covers many methods. In this course a selection of techniques is covered based on our experience that they are frequently used in industry and research institutes.

In fact  these rotators only represent the unitary part  but we will show that we can retrieve the rank-one part from the unitary part with a trick. It is thus not necessary to store the rank-one part explicitly. Francis’s algorithm tuned for working on this representation requires only O(n) flops per iteration and thus O(n²) flops in total. The algorithm is normwise backward stable and is shown to be about as accurate as the (slow) Francis QR algorithm applied to the companion matrix without exploiting the structure. It is also faster than other O(n²) methods that have been proposed  and its accuracy is comparable or better.</p>\n",

      "<p>In the era of AI and Data  it's crucial to shift our focus from merely seeking answers to understanding the importance of questions. While answers provide clarity and guidance  they are often the culmination of a questioning process that can lead to more inquiries. Albert Einstein emphasized the significance of how questions are framed  as this framing can heavily influence the answers we find. Yet  as a society  we often overlook the art of questioning: who asks the questions  their formulation  their impact on research  and our decision-making processes. Moreover  we frequently fail to scrutinize whether the answers truly address the initial questions. In this talk  I will highlight our transition to being data-rich but question-poor. I will advocate for the development of 'question science' as a complement to data science and the necessity of cultivating 'questions literacy' to better utilize the vast amounts of data at our disposal.</p>\n",

Now that AI systems play an increasingly substantial role in such decisions  they should also aim to meet ethical standards. In this module  we particularly consider the ethical principles of fairness and privacy in AI systems  both highly active fields of research. Fairness aims to avoid statistical patterns of discrimination in decision-making  such as performing far worse for certain demographic groups.

      "<p>The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) entails enormous ethical challenges. Especially  we do not fully understand how ethical perceptions about AI influence both job applicants and the organizations that use AI for hiring purposes. In this session  we will discuss important aspects of using AI in hiring processes. First  we will discuss that AI is not created equally in terms of ethical perceptions. Indeed  people view the use of AI differently depending on what aspects of the hiring process it is used for (e.g.  analyzing CV vs. analyzing one’s social media). Then  we will discuss the influence of ethical perceptions of AI in hiring on the trust individuals put in organizations that use AI in hiring.</p>\n",
      "<p>We will focus on the importance individuals lend to AI performing its expected role  and how this expectation influences their ethical perceptions of AI  and in turn the trust they put on organizations using AI in hiring. Finally  we will further discuss whether and how ethical perceptions of using AI in hiring are related to individuals’ attraction to organizations that use AI in hiring. Circling back to the beginning of the session  we will discuss that the influence of ethical perceptions of using AI in hiring are not consistent across hiring methods. For example  only individuals who consider it ethical for organizations to use AI in intrusive ways  such as analyzing social media information for traits and characteristics  viewed such organizations as more attractive.</p>\n",

      "<p>R is a flexible environment for statistical computing and graphics  which is becoming increasingly popular as a tool to get insight in often complex data. While in some ways similar to other programming languages (such as C  Java and Perl)  R is particularly suited for data analysis because ready-made functions are available for a wide variety of statistical (classical statistical tests  linear and nonlinear modeling  timeseries analysis  classification  clustering  ...) and graphical techniques.</p>\n",
      "<p>The base R program can be extended with user-submitted packages  which means new techniques are often implemented in R before being available in other software. This is one of the reasons why R is becoming the de facto standard in certain fields such as bioinformatics (Bioconductor) and financial services.</p>\n",
      "<p>This course introduces the use of the R environment for the implementation of data management  data exploration  basic statistical analysis and automation of procedures.</p>\n",
      "<p>It starts with a description of the R GUI  the use of the command line and an overview of basic data structures. The application of standard procedures to import data or to export results to external files will be illustrated.</p>\n",
      "<p>Creation of new variables  subsetting  merging and stacking of data sets will be covered in the data management section. Exploration of the data by histograms  box plots  scatter plots  summary numbers  correlation coefficients and cross-tabulations will be performed.</p>\n",
      "<p><strong>Simple statistical procedures that will be covered are:</strong></p>\n",
      "<ul><li>comparisons of observed group means (t-test  ANOVA and their non-parametric versions) and proportions</li><li>test for independence in 2-way cross tables and linear regression (focusing on the R-implementation of the statistical methods that are the subject of other modules of the statistics series)</li></ul><p>Finally  installing new packages and automation of analysis procedures will also be discussed.</p>\n",

However  these generative AI systems raise many ethical  epistemological  anthropological  psychological  economic  social  political and cultural questions.

      "            <p>The name “Bohemian matrices” was proposed for a field that has actually been studied for many years now by different researchers  not recognizing their commonality. The name comes from an acronym for BOunded HEight Matrices  of Integers  although the restriction to integers has been subsequently relaxed. The “height” of a vector is its infinity norm  and the “height” of a matrix A is the infinity norm of vec(A). The word “height” has been commonly used in the context of univariate polynomials expressed in the monomial basis: the height of a polynomial is the infinity norm of the vector of coefficients. We say “characteristic height” for the height of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix A.</p>\n",
      "<p>The idea is to restrict the study to families of matrices all of whose entries come from a finite (and hence bounded) set  called the population. Well-known examples include zero-one or binary matrices  Bernoulli matrices whose entries are either 1 or -1  and sign pattern matrices where the entries can be 1  0  or -1. One can then study Bohemian families of structured matrices  say upper Hessenberg Toeplitz Bohemian matrices  or complex symmetric tridiagonal Bohemian matrices  or symmetric matrices with entries from a restricted population  or Bohemian companion matrices  or other families.</p>\n",
      "<p>In this talk I will survey some known results  and discuss some problems that remain open. In particular  I will ask for help in finding algorithms to construct “minimal height” companion matrices for polynomials with integer coefficients; such things exist (possibly not uniquely) but there is no known good algorithm for constructing them. I will give examples where the height of the companion matrix is exponentially smaller (in the degree/dimension) than is the characteristic height. This seems interesting because lower height offers the hope of better eigenvalue conditioning. But even that is not well-understood.</p>\n",

Thus  one can use DNN for image processing  actions recognition  text classification  language processing  speech recognition  etc. However  this high success of DNN models is accompanied by a high increase of computation time  architecture complexity  and memory storage. Moreover  the deployment and exploitation of DNN models in real environments is generally related to connected sensors (cameras  microphones  temperature sensors  etc.) where the inference process needs to be executed in real time on embedded or edge resources. In this work  we present an overview of the three main compression methods (pruning  quantization  knowledge distillation) that allow to reduce the computation time and memory size of DNN models while keeping a high accuracy. Experimental results are conducted within image classification  object detection and actions recognition with DNN models that were optimized and deployed on Edge AI resources such as Jetson Nano  Jetson Xavier and Jetson Orin. The obtained results showed that we could reach a compression factor of around 6x while keeping a good accuracy  and we also observe a speedup of 3x compared to non-compressed models.<br></p>\n",

We focus on tasks in which the algorithm is required to predict exactly k labels for each instance  leading to macro-at-k metrics. The constraint couples the otherwise independent binary classification tasks  leading to a much more challenging optimization problem than standard macro-averages. We analyze the problem in two different statistical regimes  namely in the expected test utility (ETU) and the population utility (PU) frameworks. The former aims at optimizing the expected performance on a given test set  while the latter optimizes the performance on a population level. For both frameworks we derive optimal prediction rules and practical algorithmic solutions with provable statistical guarantees. Empirical results provide evidence for the competitive performance of the proposed approaches.<br></p>\n",

To find not just optimal solutions  but also 'desirable' solutions for the end user  it is increasingly important to offer AI tools that automatically learn from the user and the environment and that support the constraint modelling in interpretable ways. In this talk I will provide an overview of three different ways in which AI can augment the modeling part of combinatorial optimisation. This includes learning from the user (preference learning in VRP)  learning from the environment (end-to-end decision focussed learning) and explanation generation  that sit at the intersection of learning and reasoning. As part of this work  we are building a modern constraint programming language called CPMpy(http://cpmpy.readthedocs.io) that eases integration of multiple constraint solving paradigms with machine learning and other scientific python libraries.

Thomas Mortier </strong><strong>—</strong> <strong>Ghent University</strong><strong>) </strong></p>\n",
      "<p dir=\"ltr\">In recent years  the use of machine learning has gained popularity in solving complex tasks across multiple domains  including robotics  healthcare  biology and finance. However  with the increasing amount of data and complexity of tasks  the notion of uncertainty has become of major importance in machine learning. The ability to represent uncertainty in an efficient and trustworthy way should therefore be considered as a key feature of any machine learning method. This thesis aims to address this challenge by focusing on the development of principled tools to efficiently represent uncertainty in machine learning. In particular  the concept of set-valued prediction is highlighted  which provides end-users with multiple answers instead of a single answer with little guarantee. To this end  probabilistic classification is considered  where the unknown relationship between inputs and classes is assumed to be non-deterministic and expressed by a conditional class distribution. A distinction between several settings in classification is made and different biological applications are considered  including large-scale bacterial species identification using Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) data.</p>\n",

In this talk  Maria Rodriguez Martinez (IBM Zürich) illustrates how interpretable deep learning models can achieve both high prediction accuracy and transparency.</p>\n",
      "<p>First  she will introduce multi-modal deep learning models that predict drug response while highlighting the genetic and chemical patterns that were more informative to make a prediction. Rodriguez Martinez also discusses how reinforcement learning approaches can facilitate the early phases of drug discovery and support the personalized design of new candidate compounds.</p>\n",
      "<p>Focusing next on T cell-based immunotherapies  she presents a model to predict the binding of T cell receptors and epitopes. This model can be coupled with an easy-to-use interpretable pipeline to extract the binding rules governing the T cell binding. These approaches are a first step towards the design and engineering of receptors of improved affinity.</p>\n",

Their control is dependent on known models  and  based on these models  calculations and input data  a complex algorithm defines the output and hence the behaviour of the robot.</p>\n",

For the control of robots  reinforcement learning often requires significantly more iterations than are feasible on real systems.‍</p>\n",

      "<p>Suffering from hearing loss has a large implication on your social life. Even with modern hearing aids  it is still very difficult for a hearing impaired person to take part in a conversation when a lot of other people are talking in the background. Tragically  these situations also tend to be when communication is the most key; think of family gatherings  receptions  meeting with friends... Hearing aids fail in such scenarios because they don't know to whom the user wishes to listen and thus don't know which speaker to enhance. Instead  they become unstable  enhance the wrong speaker and eventually  most users are forced to switch off their hearing aid  effectively isolating them from the conversation. A promising solution to this problem is to decode from from detected brain activity to which speaker the user wishes to listen  called <em>auditory attention decoding</em> (AAD). The idea is to measure the electrical activity of specific regions of the brain using miniature concealed devices  and then use this data to predict who the attended speaker is using several signal processing techniques. In this talk  I will explain the core ideas behind AAD  show how some key signal processing techniques can be used and provide an intuitive understanding why brain decoding is possible.</p>\n",

The environment concerns the video game that can be controlled with a gamepad and observed by looking at the screen. The agent receives feedback from the environment in terms of rewards  for example via a game score. Based on this feedback and the observations of the environment  a reinforcement learning agent aims at learning to play the game optimally  by interacting repeatedly with the environment.

      "            <p>The behavioral approach to systems theory  put forward 40 years ago by Jan C. Willems  remained till recently an esoteric niche of research. The renewed interest in the last years is because of its unique suitability for the newly emerged data-driven paradigm  specifically the representation-free perspective on dynamical systems as sets of trajectories. A result derived in the behavioral setting that became known as the fundamental lemma started a new class of subspace-type data-driven methods. The fundamental lemma gives conditions for a non-parametric representation of a linear time-invariant system by the image of a Hankel matrix constructed from raw time series data. This course reviews the fundamental lemma  its generalizations  and related data-driven analysis  signal processing  and control methods. A prototypical signal processing problem considered in the course is interpolation and approximation of trajectories. It includes simulation  state estimation  and output tracking control as special cases. The theory leads to computationally tractable methods. Regularized version of the methods is robust to noise and model assumptions. Participants will get hands-on experience with the methods via Matlab exercises and individual work on mini-projects.</p>\n",

      "            <p>Legitimacy of data-driven research and success of data-intensive applications depend on protecting privacy in the design  realisation  deployment and maintenance of these studies and systems. Personal Data Minimization (PDM) is a core principle of privacy protection  whereby the amount of personal data in data sets is adjusted to the level needed for the legitimate data usage in mind (i.e.  for the aimed study or system functionality). Mainly  Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) tools and mechanisms are used for the PDM of micro and tabular data sets. SDC technology aims at mitigating the disclosure of privacy sensitive information to adversaries who have access to the content of such data sets. Applying SDC methods is necessary before storing the data sets  sharing them with scientific community or partner organisations  or opening them to the public. Using a SDC tool  an expert can apply advanced SDC algorithms with proper parameters to a data set (i.e.  transform the data set)  gain insights into the utility of the original and the transformed data sets  estimate the data disclosure risks of the original and the transformed data sets  and eventually make appropriate trade-offs between the indicators of data utility and data disclosure risks.</p>\n",
      "<p>The task of applying SDC into practice  however  increasingly becomes difficult due to the growth of data volume  variety  velocity ... and the availability of background information to adversaries. Data growth makes it difficult to detect potential privacy issues hidden in data sets (relating to the intrinsic characteristics of data sets) and background information makes it difficult to assess the potential risks when combining sensitive data sets with other ones (relating to the extrinsic characteristics of data sets).</p>\n",

As these technologies have a growing impact on all domains of our lives  it becomes increasingly important to map  understand and assess the challenges and opportunities they raise. This requires an interdisciplinary approach  which is why we are collaborating across faculties and departments to organise this Summer School. The programme's goal is to offer participants the latest insights on AI from various perspectives  and in particular the fields of law  ethics and policy.</p>\n",

      "            <p>There are  broadly speaking  two ways of using the word “funny” in English. The first  which relates to situations that puzzle but do not amuse  is “funny peculiar ” as when we find our car keys in the fridge or questionable charges on our phone bill. This is the sense to which Isaac Asimov alludes in his observation that “The most important words in science are not ‘Eureka’ but ‘that’s funny.’” The second relates to the sense of humour  to amusing situations that make us laugh  often because they have been deliberately engineered by others to do precisely that. </p>\n",
      "<p>It turns out that computers excel at the first sense of “funny ” both at fostering a puzzling sense of the peculiar in their users and at recognizing user behaviours that are statistically out of the ordinary  but stumble rather badly on the second. The fact that we use “funny” to describe these very different kinds of experience suggests that both share a common grounding in the incongruous  but a formal and/or algorithmic means of converting “funny peculiar” into “funny ha-ha” has proven stubbornly elusive to humour theorists and computationalists alike. The gulf between the two is most easily bridged in the case of the pun – the form of humour on which machines have shown the most success to date – since pun-words themselves serve as a shallow bridge between multiple words and senses. But machines still find it acutely difficult to look beyond the pun  to see intention in the peculiarities of others or to imbue their own creations with comical intent. However  just as one person’s funny peculiar is another’s funny ha-ha  machines can mine the large grey area between the two in ways that make their efforts at humour more than accidental if still less than entirely knowing and deliberate.</p>\n",

      "            <p>Non-parametric methods in time series are well known. Schuster's periodogram was applied in 1898 to disprove Knott's hypothesis that earthquakes are a periodic phenomenon  while later it was used to analyse the periodicity of Sunspots. Nonetheless  such non-parametric periodogram based methods are typically considered an exploratory tool to understand the dynamics present in time series data. In that paradigm  such a non-parametric analysis can be used as a preparatory step towards a parametric model building within the Autoregressive(-Integrated) Moving Average (ARIMA) framework.<br><br>Time series analysis is somewhat complementary to system identification where the most important difference is the experimental design and the proceeding data analysis. In system identification  one has access to the input and output time series whereas in time series analysis only the output time series is measurable such that the input time series is typically denoted as the innovation process. A natural question that arises in time series is: can we reconstruct the input signal in a non-parametric way? Identifying the input or innovation process in a non-parametric way  while modeling the dynamics in a parametric way leads to a semi-parametric time series model.<br><br>In this lecture  we will explore this question. A reconstruction in the strict sense is not possible however we will see that by virtue of Wold's decomposition theorem a proxy of the innovations driving the time series can be built. Furthermore  we check the scenarios where one should prefer such a semi-parametric time series model. It is particularly advantageous when the innovation process exhibits non-stationarities while the dynamics remain time-invariant. This aspect will be illustrated by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n",

      "            <p>We introduce a new task  unsupervised vision-language (VL) grammar induction. Given an image-caption pair  the goal is to extract a shared hierarchical structure for both image and language simultaneously. We argue that such structured output  grounded in both modalities  is a clear step towards the high-level understanding of multimodal information. Besides challenges existing in conventional visually grounded grammar induction tasks  VL grammar induction requires a model to capture contextual semantics and perform a fine-grained alignment. To address these challenges  we propose a novel method  CLIORA  which constructs a shared vision-language constituency tree structure with context-dependent semantics for all possible phrases in different levels of the tree. It computes a matching score between each constituent and image region  trained via contrastive learning. It integrates two levels of fusion  namely at feature-level and at score-level  so as to allow fine-grained alignment. We introduce a new evaluation metric for VL grammar induction  CCRA  and show a 3.3% improvement over a strong baseline on Flickr30k Entities. We also evaluate our model via two derived tasks  i.e.  language grammar induction and phrase grounding  and improve over the state-of-the-art for both.</p>\n",

      "            <p>In recent years  we have seen significant steps taken in the development of self-driving cars. Multiple companies are starting to roll out impressive systems that work in a variety of settings. These systems can sometimes give the impression that full self-driving is just around the corner and that we would soon build cars without even a steering wheel. The increase in the level of autonomy and control given to an AI provides an opportunity for new modes of human-vehicle interaction. However  surveys have shown that giving more control to an AI in self-driving cars is accompanied by a degree of uneasiness by passengers. In an attempt to alleviate this issue  recent works have taken a natural language-oriented approach by allowing the passenger to give commands that refer to specific objects in the visual scene. Nevertheless  this is only half the task as the car should also understand the physical destination of the command  which is what we focus on in this paper. We propose an extension in which we annotate the 3D destination that the car needs to reach after executing the given command and evaluate multiple different baselines on predicting this destination location. Additionally  we introduce a model that outperforms the prior works adapted for this particular setting.</p>\n",

In this course we will deep-dive in the current state of the art in creating Knowledge on WebScale. Your personal data, data published publicly on the Web and data explicitly shared with you, becomes your Knowledge Graph that applications and services can use to assist you in your day to day activities.</p> <p>Data scientists and engineers today claim 80% of their time goes to preparing and integrating the data: let us take you on a quest to fully automate data integration.</p>\n",

A companion matrix is an upper Hessenberg matrix that is of unitary-plus-rank-one form, that is, it is the sum of a unitary matrix and a rank-one matrix.

It is also used in the <strong>storytelling</strong> of the game and the <strong>safety monitoring</strong> of the athlete/venue. </p> <p dir=\"ltr\">The Becoming An Olympian In Sports Analytics (BOSA) Winter School, <strong>organized by the IDLab Sports Data Science teams of Ghent University and the University of Antwerp</strong>, focuses on each of these topics. It is<strong> a week-long intensive course </strong>bringing together junior and senior academics and practitioners in the field of sports data science. <strong>Two tracks will be organized in parallel</strong>  with sufficient cross-pollination: (i) a track focused on sports  scientists that want to gather more AI/data science skills, and (ii) a  more hands-on track for computer scientists to apply their  expertise/skills in a sports context.
