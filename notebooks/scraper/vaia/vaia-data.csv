For those working with AI on a daily basis, staying up to date with the newest techniques within various domains is a challenge. In this seminar series, academic experts will bring you up to speed with the hottest topics: Advanced GenAI, Knowledge Graphs, MLOps and AI@Edge. All seminars include a hands-on component.| Advanced GenAI (17 April 2024  12.30-15.30h) Dr. Thomas Winters These  days  we are surrounded by creative text and image generators like GPT  and diffusion models that seem to be able to generate anything we want.  But how do we ensure that these types of AI truly aid us in overcoming  our unique challenges? This talk sheds light on several techniques for  controlling such generative models. We look at several powerful prompt  engineering techniques – the art of enhancing our communication with AI –  and useful ways of connecting these generators to other systems. We  dive into the world of autoregressive text generators  learn their inner  mechanisms and which training phases they went through to get to the  current state-of-the-art text generators. These insights help us  understand why certain prompt engineering techniques (such as few-shot  prompting  role-prompting and chain-of-thought prompting) are able to  outperform simpler prompting methods. We also briefly look at several  other techniques to overcome the limitations of such models  such as  retrieval-augmented generation and function calling. Similarly  we  uncover the workings of diffusion models and show several techniques to  gain more control over the generated images. We show how even some of  AI's classic hard problems  such as humour generation  become even more  within reach thanks to these large language models and their prompt  engineering techniques. Knowledge Graphs (17 April 2024  16.00-19.00h) Prof. Pieter Bonte and prof.

Lara Luys One  of the main challenges for industry today is to get machine learning  models out of the proof-of-concept phase and into production. This is  not an easy task since data in production is not static  due to which  the model performance can degrade over time. Machine learning operations  or MLOps is a paradigm that aims to address this problem. Being a  contraction of Machine Learning and DevOps  MLOps focuses on developing  and maintaining machine learning models in production. This includes  training  evaluating as well as monitoring the model. In this seminar   the MLOps pipeline and the underlying principles will be explained   illustrated by means of a number of tools that can be used in the MLOps  process. AI@Edge (25 April 2024  16.00-19.00h) Prof. Hans Hallez and drs. Gregory De Ruyter Edge  Computing has been proven to be an optimised way to delegate  computation from the cloud towards the devices where the sensing takes  place. Edge computing on embedded devices mostly limits itself towards  compression  filtering or other basic analysis. Recent trends also show  that devices near the edge of the sensor network are capable of machine  learning algorithms. In this session  we will explore different  techniques to bring machine learning towards the edge network and deploy  these algorithms. First  we will give an overview of what embedded  devices are  and how we can perform machine learning at these devices  both in inference and in training. Second  we will give a hands-on  demonstration as an inspiration of how machine learning at the edge can  be implemented. |Current Trends in AI  Advanced GenAI (17 April 2024  12.30-15.30h) Dr. Thomas Winters These  days  we are surrounded by creative text and image generators like GPT  and diffusion models that seem to be able to generate anything we want.

In today's world  organisations in  every sector must be aware of the ethical implications of their actions  in the digital realm. From the handling of personal data to the  development of new technologies  the decisions we make have the  potential to impact individuals  society  and the environment in  profound ways. By participating in this course  you will gain the  knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the complex ethical landscape  of the digital world and make informed decisions that align with your  organisation's values. Our course will cover a range of important topics  including ethics  frameworks and tools  regulation and legal issues  developing ethical  technology  technology assessment  ethical dilemmas  and ethics in data  and visualisation. This course is designed for professionals working in a wide range of organisations and industries. Whether you are employed in government  industry  academia  or the non-profit sector  you will benefit from the comprehensive coverage of key topics in Digital Ethics. The course is particularly relevant for those working in fields such as technology  interaction design  data analysis  policymaking  law  and research. However  anyone with an interest in Digital Ethics and the impact of technology on society will find value in this course. Session 1: Ethics frameworks – Thursday 18 April 2024  During this session  we will explore the various frameworks that can be  used to justify ethical decisions  including virtue ethics  consequence  ethics  and duty ethics. The participants will learn how to 'think  ethically'  and how these basic ethics frameworks can be applied to  various scenarios in which digital technologies play a central role. We  will also explore the concept of responsibility  including the different  types of responsibility (moral  legal  causal or role responsibility)  that can arise in the digital realm and discuss the responsibility gap.  This session will provide attendees with a solid foundation in the basic  principles of ethics and their relation to digital technology. Session 2: Building Ethical Foundations - Thursday 25 April 2024  This session aims to create a communal learning environment among the  participants  both online and on-site. During this session  participants  will introduce themselves  share their professional backgrounds and  discuss their expectations for the course  providing invaluable insight  for the instructors to tailor the subsequent sessions. Additionally   participants will reflect on the ethical aspects of their jobs   exploring potential ethical dilemmas within their specific work contexts  such as government  industry  academia  or non-profit sectors. This  early engagement is designed to foster a deeper understanding and  awareness of the ethical issues to be explored throughout the course   setting the stage for a more insightful reflection during the closing  session. Session 3: Tools and methods for ethical decision making - Thursday 2 May 2024  In this session we will introduce tools and methods that can be used to  make ethical decisions in different contexts  such as in industry   government  academia and research. Participants will learn about  practical frameworks and tools such as the guidance ethics approach  the  AI Blindspots and the Data Ethics Decision Aid. This session will  provide attendees with the basic tools and methods in the practice of  ethical decision-making in the digital realm. Session 4: Technology assessment in practice – Thursday 16 May 2024  This session will provide insight into the impact and effects of  technology  and will introduce tools and methods for assessing the risks  of innovation and averting undesirable consequences of new  technologies. The session will look into the challenges of achieving  (positive or negative) impacts with technology due to the interplay of  technology  society  organisations and individuals. A dedicated focus  will be on the impact of AI technologies in a government context as well  as on evaluating the results of social corporate responsibility actions  in the context of a company. This session will provide attendees with  practical examples of how to effectively assess the risks and potential  consequences of technology. Session 5: Designing ethical technology – Thursday 23 May 2024  In this session  we will explore different approaches to designing  technology that takes into account the needs and values of human beings.  We will explore humanity-centered design (including design thinking)   inclusive design  value-centered design  and participatory design (or  co-creation). We will then discuss how technologies are often designed  in a way that threatens our digital well-being  and which strategies can  be used to improve digital well-being. This session will provide  attendees with the tools and knowledge they need to create ethical  technology that is designed with people at its core. Session 6: Ethical topics and dilemmas – Thursday 30 May 2024 This session will explore the application of behaviorist principles in  digital technologies  particularly in the realm of surveillance. It will  highlight how these technologies not only observe but actively  influence and modify user behavior  raising important ethical questions  about privacy  autonomy  and the power dynamics between users and  technology providers. The session will emphasize the need for ethical  guidelines to address the challenges posed by digital surveillance. This  session further examines the various functions fairness and equality  hold in the AI governance debate. Drawing from political philosophical  theories of justice and practical use-cases  a relational perspective on  AI is developed to understand better the social and technical dynamics  that give rise to digital injustice. This session will provide attendees  with an understanding of the ethical challenges that can arise in the  digital world  and the tools and frameworks that can be used to address  them. Session 7: Legal and policy issues – Thursday 6 June 2024  This session will explore a number of legal issues that arise in the  digital realm. This session will first provide attendees with an  understanding of appropriate legal frameworks related to the free flow  of information  (personal) data protection  and the principles  rights  and obligations of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  This session will also provide a comprehensive review of the impact AI  may have on individual and collective human rights across various  sectors. The participants will learn about the technical legal  instruments at their disposal to combat AI discrimination  including  legal tools related to direct and indirect discrimination  as well as  discrimination by association. Moreover  participants will be invited to  critically reflect on the resilience of ethics in the context of AI.  This approach to AI will consider high-level legal instruments within  the European Union  such as the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights  the  proposed AI Act  and the set of equality directives. A comparative law  approach will also be mobilized to provide a better understanding of  addressing AI challenges with traditional legal instruments. Session 8: Ethics in data and visualisation – Thursday 13 June 2024  In this session  we will discuss the ethical aspects of handling and  visualising of data. We will start by examining how data are  'constructed' and therefore are inherently 'biased'  rather than  representing an objective truth. We cross over to understand the value  of visualising data  acknowledging its potential risk to yet further  objectify this constructed  situated nature of data. We then dive into  how some data visualisations can be (unintentionally) perceived as  unethical  whether through potentially misleading design choices  the  use of dubious data  the omission of uncertainties  or the disregard of  cognitive biases. This session aims to provide practical skills and  reflective insights for handling and visualising data in ways that are  more transparent  equitable and responsible. Session 9: Closing and reflection – Thursday 20 June 2024 The seventh and final session will be a closing session focused on  reflection. In this session  participants will have the opportunity to  reflect on how the topics covered in the previous sessions apply to  their own professional situations. This session will provide a space for  attendees to share their thoughts  insights  and experiences  and to  discuss how they plan to incorporate the knowledge and skills they have  gained into their work. This will be a valuable opportunity for  participants to consolidate their learning and to develop a personal  plan for applying the principles of Digital Ethics in their professional  lives. |Digital Ethics  As our reliance on technology continues to grow  the importance of  digital ethics cannot be overstated.

This session will also provide a comprehensive review of the impact AI  may have on individual and collective human rights across various  sectors. The participants will learn about the technical legal  instruments at their disposal to combat AI discrimination  including  legal tools related to direct and indirect discrimination  as well as  discrimination by association. Moreover  participants will be invited to  critically reflect on the resilience of ethics in the context of AI.  This approach to AI will consider high-level legal instruments within  the European Union  such as the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights  the  proposed AI Act  and the set of equality directives. A comparative law  approach will also be mobilized to provide a better understanding of  addressing AI challenges with traditional legal instruments. Session 8: Ethics in data and visualisation – Thursday 13 June 2024  In this session  we will discuss the ethical aspects of handling and  visualising of data. We will start by examining how data are  'constructed' and therefore are inherently 'biased'  rather than  representing an objective truth. We cross over to understand the value  of visualising data  acknowledging its potential risk to yet further  objectify this constructed  situated nature of data. We then dive into  how some data visualisations can be (unintentionally) perceived as  unethical  whether through potentially misleading design choices  the  use of dubious data  the omission of uncertainties  or the disregard of  cognitive biases. This session aims to provide practical skills and  reflective insights for handling and visualising data in ways that are  more transparent  equitable and responsible. Session 9: Closing and reflection – Thursday 20 June 2024 The seventh and final session will be a closing session focused on  reflection. In this session  participants will have the opportunity to  reflect on how the topics covered in the previous sessions apply to  their own professional situations. This session will provide a space for  attendees to share their thoughts  insights  and experiences  and to  discuss how they plan to incorporate the knowledge and skills they have  gained into their work. This will be a valuable opportunity for  participants to consolidate their learning and to develop a personal  plan for applying the principles of Digital Ethics in their professional  lives.

Big Data for Health &amp; Care: The Arisal of Data Spaces|https://www.vaia.be/en/courses/big-data-for-health-care-the-arisal-of-data-spaces|23/04/2024|symposium-Hasselt-Hasselt University|23 Apr 2024 10:00 - 17:30|English|Corda Campus - Kempische Steenweg 293/16, 3500 Hasselt|Target audience: health data enthusiasts||Registration is mandatory|free|https://www.uhasselt.be/en/instituten-en/biomed-en/immunology/biomedical-data-sciences/big-data-for-health-care-the-arisal-of-data-spaces|Symposium|"  The Research Group in Biomedical Data Sciences of UHasselt and The European Institute for Innovation through Health Data (i~HD) are delighted to invite you to the “Big Data in Health and Care: The Arisal of Data Spaces” Symposium. The term 'data space' has gained a lot of traction lately, specifically with the upcoming 'European Health Data Space' legislation. The definition of data space is still under discussion. However, we and others (e.g. NCP Flanders) describe it as ""a  decentralized infrastructure for trustworthy data sharing and exchange  in data ecosystems, based on commonly agreed principles."""|" In recent years  a series of health data spaces have arised. However   at the moment  the strategic oversight is lost and many questions  remain. For example: Which data space initiatives are out there?How do they relate to each other?How will they work together/in synergy to maximize the impact?How will this affect the local data management at the level of the individual data partners? With this symposium  we aspire to facilitate an in-depth exploration of data spaces and research infrastructures  elucidate challenges and best practices for large-scale projects  and engage in a panel debate on the feasibility of implementing and integrating various data spaces at different levels  all underpinning the advancement of healthcare data sharing and research. The  event plans to highlight different Belgian data spaces and to delve  into profound discussions during panel debates  exploring complex topics  like challenges and future perspectives in health data sharing and analysis. As i~HD will co-moderate the event  the bridge towards Europe is guaranteed. Target Audience: The symposium is tailored for health data enthusiasts  from Belgium and neighboring countries. While expecting diverse  attendees  both beginners and experts  we are aiming for accessibility  without compromising depth. In our sessions  we explore a wide array of dimensions  ranging from  geographical nuances to various data types and the complexities of  transmural care. We delve into the intricacies of first-line care   hospital settings  and innovative mobile healthcare (mHealth).  Furthermore  our exploration extends to discovering the transformative  potential inherent in different data types  encompassing everything from  imaging to -omics and harmonized clinical data. #JoinTheJourney  All speakers are asked to touch upon the following questions in preparation of their talk: What are their “why” and expected clinical impact?Which socio-technical challenges are they trying to address?What are their main achievements so far?What excites them for the future?10:00-10:10 | Meeting Start (Welcome) Liesbet M.

It spans a wide range of multivariate methods including path analysis  mediation analysis  confirmatory factor analysis  growth curve modeling  and many more. Many applications of SEM can be found in the social  economic  behavioral and health sciences  but the technology is increasingly used in disciplines like biology  neuroscience and operation research. SEM is often used to test theories or hypotheses that can be represented by a path diagram. In a path diagram  observed variables are depicted by boxes  while latent variables (hypothetical constructs measured by multiple indicators) are depicted by circles. Hypothesized (possibly causal) effects among these variables are represented by single-headed arrows. If you had ever found yourself drawing a path diagram in order to get a better overview of the complex interrelations among some key variables in your data  this course is for you. The first day of the course provides an introduction to the theory and application of structural equation modeling  and illustrates how to use the open-source R package `lavaan’ (see https://lavaan.org) to conduct an SEM analysis. On the second day  we discuss several special topics that are often needed by applied users (handling missing data  nonnormal data  categorical data  longitudinal data  multilevel data  etc.). With the exception of a short practical session at the end of the first day  the two days are mostly lectures  to maximize the amount of information that we can teach. However  do-it-yourself practicals (with written feedback and solutions) will be made available and illustrate all the topics that are covered in this course. Target audience This course targets everyone with an interest in testing theories or models that involve relationships between both observed and latent variables. The audience for this course can include both novices with little or no previous experience with SEM  as well as existing users who wish to refresh or update their theoretical and practical understanding of structural equation modeling.

To develop such systems  black-box AI methods (such as  deep learning) are not well-suited  because they lack the required  transparency and explainability. A more promising approach are  knowledge-based AI systems  which derive their 'intelligence' not from  data  but from logical models of rules  regulations and expert  knowledge.

As these technologies have a growing impact on all domains of our lives, it becomes increasingly important to map, understand and assess the challenges and opportunities they raise. The programme's goal is to offer participants the latest insights on AI from various perspectives, and in particular the fields of law, ethics and policy.| In 2021  KU Leuven organised the first edition of the Summer School  on the Law  Ethics and Policy of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Given the  programme's overwhelming success  three editions have taken place thus  far. The fourth edition will take place from 1 to 10 July 2024. The Summer School aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the  various legal  ethical and policy-related issues around AI and  algorithm-driven processes more broadly. As these technologies have a  growing impact on all domains of our lives  it becomes increasingly  important to map  understand and assess the challenges and opportunities  they raise. This requires an interdisciplinary approach  which is why  we are collaborating across faculties and departments to organise this  Summer School. The programme's goal is to offer participants the latest  insights on AI from various perspectives  and in particular the fields  of law  ethics and policy.  The lectures are provided by renowned academics  policy-makers from  EU and international institutions as well as practitioners  allowing  participants to grasp not only the theoretical but also the practical  implications of the use of AI in these fields.

Participants receive a certificate of attendance with the equivalence  of 3 ECTS credits. Those interested also have an opportunity to share  their research with fellow participants through a research presentation  session.  Thus far  the Summer School has taken place as a hybrid event  enabling participants to join both on campus and online.  Whether physically or virtually  we look forward to welcoming you to Leuven! Course overview The Summer School covers a range of topics that will enable  participants to better grasp the various legal  ethical and policy  implications of the development and use of AI in society. All lectures  are taught in English. The schedule of the Summer School's 2023 edition can be found here. Most lectures focus on horizontal domains of interest  covering topics such as:  Philosophy of AI Ethics of AI AI and Data Protection Law AI and Competition Law AI and Intellectual Property Law AI and Consumer Protection AI and Liability Law AI and Labour Law AI and Fairnes The European Commission's proposals for an AI Regulation  the Digital Services Act & the Digital Markets Act AI governance and the role of European & International institutions  Though Artificial Intelligence is a general purpose technology  many  of its legal  ethical and policy-related implications are context- or  sector-specific. Therefore  the programme also explores several vertical  domains. These cover inter alia:  AI and Law Enforcement AI and Public Services AI and Warfare AI and Healthcare AI and Education AI and Legal Tech  At the end of the course  participants who attended 90% of the  classes and passed the exam receive a certificate of attendance with an  equivalence of 3 ECTS credits.

The  programme has been designed with a specific need in the job market in  mind: many current employees in for example R&D divisions of leading  companies are highly skilled but did not receive specific training on  AI in their formal education. Perhaps you  too  experience the need to  bring your AI skills up to date and are looking for a qualitative AI  course to do that. This postgraduate training allows professionals to  acquire in one year a solid academic knowledge of artificial  intelligence  as well as insight into the domains of image and language  (computer vision/NLP) and business aspects of AI.  The postgraduate programme Artificial Intelligence in Business and Industry stands  firmly on its own but also opens the door to more. Participants can  choose to follow a follow-up track into the Advanced Master AI in Business and Industry (to  be launched in September 2023)  where they gain access to the wider  range of in-depth  broadening and  in particular  more applied modules.  The courses offered in the postgraduate programme form an integral part  of the Advanced Master Artificial Intelligence in Business and Industry   and participants who pass the courses in the postgraduate programme  will be granted exemptions when following the rest of the master’s  programme. The programme aims at different  kinds of engineers (e.g. in Engineering Science  Engineering Technology   or Business Engineers who majored in data science or applied computer  science). In addition  the programme is open to masters in mathematics  and physics. In general  any participant with a master’s degree that  offers sufficient background in mathematics  programming and technology  will be admitted. If you do not have one of the aforementioned master  diplomas  you can submit a file with your motivation and CV to the  programme committee  who will assess your application. Note that Python  proficiency (basic) is required. An optional 6-month subscription to  Datacamp can be provided upon registration.  While recently  graduated students are welcome  the programme also offers added value to  professionals with field experience  wishing to re- or upskill  themselves in the field of Artificial Intelligence in order to make the  most of their career opportunities. The programme specifically caters to  participants looking for a theoretical  academically grounded approach  to AI. Given the advanced content of the courses  the profiles most  suitable for this postgraduate are  for example  IT developers and  functional analysts or R&D staff  engineers  project leaders and  managers. The programme starts with the theoretical AI foundations that are indispensable for professionals. Participants therefore get 3 academic courses that teach them the scientific basics of artificial intelligence. In addition  the door is opened to industrial applications and general business applications with the courses in the second semester. Fundamentals of AI In this course  you will acquire a deep knowledge and insight into foundational techniques from Artificial Intelligence  including search methods and their applications to games  the version spaces algorithm for machine learning  constraint processing techniques  strips planning and theorem proving for first-order predicate logic. You will be able to simulate each of the above techniques with pen and paper on small new examples and have insight into the relevance of these techniques for applications in domains such as manufacturing  health  education  logistics  manufacturing  and robotics.  Machine Learning and Inductive Inference This  course will familiarize you with the domain of machine learning  which  concerns techniques to build software that can learn how to perform a  certain task (or improve its performance on it) by studying examples of  how it has been accomplished previously  and in a broader sense the  discovery of knowledge from observations (inductive inference).After following this course  you will have a basic understanding of the general principles of learninghave an overview of the existing techniques for machine learning and data miningunderstand how these techniques work  and why they workbe able to implement programs that learn or exhibit adaptive behavior  using these techniquesbe up-to-date with the current state of the art in machine learning researchbe able to contribute to contemporary machine learning research  Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning The  course aims to introduce the basic techniques  methods and properties  of ANN and to study their application to selected problems. The basic  concepts will be introduced in the lectures. Advanced topics and recent  research results will be touched upon occasionally. You will study and  develop explicit neural network models for selected applications. Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing The  course introduces natural language processing technologies and their  applications in a variety of tasks  which include text mining  machine  translation  question answering and dialogue modelling. It also  introduces computer vision algorithms and their applications such as  image classification  object detection  and image segmentation. Special  attention goes to applications that require the joint processing of  language and visual data  as this is a natural way to interact with  machines.  The students will gain insights into suitable machine  learning algorithms that ideally are trained with limited annotated  examples or human feedback. They will learn how to build and critically  assess an application making use of the most recent techniques and  resources.  Business Analytics In this course  you will  learn to understand how business problems can be formulated with  advanced analytics techniques as a potential solution. You will be able  to reason on the organizational and managerial aspects of applying big  data and analytics techniques and understand how prescriptive analytics  and causal ML can help to use analytics for business decision-making.  The course teaches you how analytical modelling techniques can be  optimized and evaluated from a profit-driven perspective and how  analytics techniques can exploit network-based information.  After  following “Business Analytics”  you will know how to deal with  unstructured data in the form of textual inputs  and how to use such  data for practical business applications such as sentiment analysis or  social media analytics. The course deals with how state-of-the-art  explainability techniques can give insights into black-box machine  learning models and how process mining techniques can be applied to data  sets originating from process-aware information systems  including  automated process discovery  conformance checking and extension. Upon  completion of the course  you know which data science tools and  environments are important for realizing applications of machine  learning in business  including platforms such as Hadoop  Spark  etc   which business applications might benefit from deep learning techniques   and how to apply them and evaluate their appropriateness. |AI in Business and Industry  The Postgraduate Certificate: Artificial Intelligence in Business and Industry aims  to give engineers  computer scientists and other professionals the  opportunity to specialise in the field of artificial intelligence.

Note that Python  proficiency (basic) is required. An optional 6-month subscription to  Datacamp can be provided upon registration.  While recently  graduated students are welcome  the programme also offers added value to  professionals with field experience  wishing to re- or upskill  themselves in the field of Artificial Intelligence in order to make the  most of their career opportunities. The programme specifically caters to  participants looking for a theoretical  academically grounded approach  to AI. Given the advanced content of the courses  the profiles most  suitable for this postgraduate are  for example  IT developers and  functional analysts or R&D staff  engineers  project leaders and  managers. The programme starts with the theoretical AI foundations that are indispensable for professionals. Participants therefore get 3 academic courses that teach them the scientific basics of artificial intelligence. In addition  the door is opened to industrial applications and general business applications with the courses in the second semester. Fundamentals of AI In this course  you will acquire a deep knowledge and insight into foundational techniques from Artificial Intelligence  including search methods and their applications to games  the version spaces algorithm for machine learning  constraint processing techniques  strips planning and theorem proving for first-order predicate logic. You will be able to simulate each of the above techniques with pen and paper on small new examples and have insight into the relevance of these techniques for applications in domains such as manufacturing  health  education  logistics  manufacturing  and robotics.  Machine Learning and Inductive Inference This  course will familiarize you with the domain of machine learning  which  concerns techniques to build software that can learn how to perform a  certain task (or improve its performance on it) by studying examples of  how it has been accomplished previously  and in a broader sense the  discovery of knowledge from observations (inductive inference).After following this course  you will have a basic understanding of the general principles of learninghave an overview of the existing techniques for machine learning and data miningunderstand how these techniques work  and why they workbe able to implement programs that learn or exhibit adaptive behavior  using these techniquesbe up-to-date with the current state of the art in machine learning researchbe able to contribute to contemporary machine learning research  Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning The  course aims to introduce the basic techniques  methods and properties  of ANN and to study their application to selected problems. The basic  concepts will be introduced in the lectures. Advanced topics and recent  research results will be touched upon occasionally. You will study and  develop explicit neural network models for selected applications. Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing The  course introduces natural language processing technologies and their  applications in a variety of tasks  which include text mining  machine  translation  question answering and dialogue modelling. It also  introduces computer vision algorithms and their applications such as  image classification  object detection  and image segmentation. Special  attention goes to applications that require the joint processing of  language and visual data  as this is a natural way to interact with  machines.  The students will gain insights into suitable machine  learning algorithms that ideally are trained with limited annotated  examples or human feedback. They will learn how to build and critically  assess an application making use of the most recent techniques and  resources.  Business Analytics In this course  you will  learn to understand how business problems can be formulated with  advanced analytics techniques as a potential solution. You will be able  to reason on the organizational and managerial aspects of applying big  data and analytics techniques and understand how prescriptive analytics  and causal ML can help to use analytics for business decision-making.  The course teaches you how analytical modelling techniques can be  optimized and evaluated from a profit-driven perspective and how  analytics techniques can exploit network-based information.  After  following “Business Analytics”  you will know how to deal with  unstructured data in the form of textual inputs  and how to use such  data for practical business applications such as sentiment analysis or  social media analytics. The course deals with how state-of-the-art  explainability techniques can give insights into black-box machine  learning models and how process mining techniques can be applied to data  sets originating from process-aware information systems  including  automated process discovery  conformance checking and extension. Upon  completion of the course  you know which data science tools and  environments are important for realizing applications of machine  learning in business  including platforms such as Hadoop  Spark  etc   which business applications might benefit from deep learning techniques   and how to apply them and evaluate their appropriateness.  The postgraduate programme on Artificial Intelligence in Business and  Industry aims to give engineers, computer scientists and other  professionals the opportunity to specialise in the field of artificial  intelligence. This programme allows professionals to acquire a solid  academic knowledge of AI within one year, along with insight into the  domains of image and language (computer vision/NLP) and business aspects  of AI.  https://puc.kuleuven.be/nl/opleiding/xdojwgdemjla3bpz Postgraduate Certificate postgraduate-Kortrijk-KU Leuven Postuniversitair Centrum

The problems or challenges we wish to address in this 1-day course are: Adopt AI or die: there is a push to use a form of artificial  intelligence for each organization  and failure to do so seems to imply  the end of your organization’s history. But how do you ensure that your  investments in AI are sustainable and successfully adopted by your  colleagues and employees? While you are adapting to this new technological context  you will also have to deal with new regulations. How will you do this? Lastly  adopting technological and legal change is not something you  do on your own  so what are methods to facilitate this change in your  organization? While not absolutely necessary  it helps to have a clear challenge in  mind when joining this session. Rob will invite you to work on your  innovation case or with someone in case you lack one. Knowledge of legal frameworks or AI is not necessary. Session 1: How to and how not to Introduce Automation on the Work Floor We will look at practical  theoretical concepts to understand  innovation on the work floor and the tension between users and  technology. The aim is to understand all successful technology  adoptions as innovations that change users’ daily practices. Next  we discuss cases where AI or industry 4.0 applications were  introduced and what these meant for different stakeholders. If you have a  case  you wish to discuss  be sure to contact Rob Heyman to discuss  this as part of the session. Session 2: Boosting Operational Efficiency by Reducing Digital Friction and Increasing Agility If you believe innovation can only be successful if practices change  then it follows that regulations can only be successful if regulations change practices  too. In this part we look at the particular challenges we experienced during the implementation of the GDPR and what this might mean for the implementation of the AI Act. Session 3: Improving Information Protection and Governance During the last part of the day  we will use a case for innovation of your choosing and define a workshop or process to include colleagues and employees in this process. In this interactive part  you will learn a few facilitation methods and the key ingredients to define co-creation projects on your work floor. This training was designed for decision  makers from public organizations that want to fully empower workforces  with flexible digital workplaces  increased agility and stronger  information protection to address current business needs and evolving  challenges.

This is because the physician-patient relationship contains inherent inequalities of knowledge  skills  and control of resources  and it treats matters both intimate and potentially of great importance to the patient (Rhodes 2001; Nickel & Frank 2020). These responsibilities include physician’s obligation to earn trust and be trustworthy (Rhodes 2001; 2020). The field of psychiatric medicine faces additional ethical challenges specifically related to patient trust. As artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies (in diagnosis  relapse prevention  and treatment) begin to play a larger role in all medicine  and specifically psychiatry  these ethical challenges may be exacerbated or complicated.

The fact that many practical problems deal with continuous outcomes (e.g. income  blood pressure  temperature  affect) makes linear regression a popular tool  and most of us will be familiar with the concept of drawing a line through a cloud of data points. The first two sessions of this module introduce the conceptual framework of this method using the simple case of a single predictor. Formulas and technicalities are kept to a minimum and the main focus is on interpretation of results and assessing model validity. This includes confidence statements on the predictor effect (hypothesis tests and confidence intervals)  using the regression model to predict future results and verification of model assumptions. In session 3 and 4 we allow for more than one predictor leading to the multiple linear regression model. We focus on either explanation or prediction. How to come to a parsimonious model starting from a large number of predictors will be discussed in detail. In these complex linear models special attention will be given to interpreting individual predictor effects  as they critically depend on other terms in the model and underlying relations between predictors (confounding). In the last session a more elaborate data analysis is discussed. We touch on problems where linear regression is not appropriate and replaced by related approaches such as generalized linear models and mixed models. Different features will be illustrated with case examples from the instructors practical experience  and participants are encouraged to bring examples from their own work. Hands-on exercises are worked out behind the PC using the R software. Target audience This course targets professionals and investigators from all areas who are involved in prediction problems or need to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more explanatory variables. Fees The participation fee is 1100 EUR for participants from the private sector. Reduced prices apply to students and staff from non-profit  social profit  and government organizations. An exam fee of 35 EUR will be applied. Industry  private sector  profession*: € 1100Non profit  government  higher education staff: € 825(Doctoral) students  unemployed: € 495 *If two or more employees from the same company enrol simultaneously for this course a reduction of 20% on the course fee is taken into account starting from the second enrolment.

The roots are found by computing the eigenvalues of the associated companion matrix. A companion matrix is an upper Hessenberg matrix that is of unitary-plus-rank-one form, that is, it is the sum of a unitary matrix and a rank-one matrix. When running Francis’s implicitly-shifted QR algorithm this property is preserved, and exactly that is exploited here.| To compactly store the matrix we will show that only 3n-1 rotators are required  so the storage space is O(n). In fact  these rotators only represent the unitary part  but we will show that we can retrieve the rank-one part from the unitary part with a trick. It is thus not necessary to store the rank-one part explicitly. Francis’s algorithm tuned for working on this representation requires only O(n) flops per iteration and thus O(n²) flops in total. The algorithm is normwise backward stable and is shown to be about as accurate as the (slow) Francis QR algorithm applied to the companion matrix without exploiting the structure. It is also faster than other O(n²) methods that have been proposed  and its accuracy is comparable or better.

Data analysis helps sports entities evaluate the performance of their  athletes and assess the recruitment necessary to improve the team's  performance. It also evaluates the strong and weak areas of their  opponents, enabling coaches to make the right decision on their tactics.  But data is not only used in performance optimization. It is also used in the storytelling of the game and the safety monitoring of the athlete/venue.  The Becoming An Olympian In Sports Analytics (BOSA) Winter School, organized by the IDLab Sports Data Science teams of Ghent University and the University of Antwerp, focuses on each of these topics. It is a week-long intensive course bringing together junior and senior academics and practitioners in the field of sports data science. Two tracks will be organized in parallel  with sufficient cross-pollination: (i) a track focused on sports  scientists that want to gather more AI/data science skills, and (ii) a  more hands-on track for computer scientists to apply their  expertise/skills in a sports context. The Winter School is open to people coming from academia and professionals active within the sports sector.| During the first three days  BOSA participants will gain fundamental and practical skills from both disciplines (sport and data science) and combine/mix them in the final hackathon project in which they will intensively work together in a multidisciplinary context.  The hackathon will require participants to put together the diverse  skill sets they bring to the table. During the hackathon  they will also  be in close contact with the end users/federations that define the  hackathon topics.

Starting from a holistic perspective, it covers the interactions between technology, humans and processes throughout the lifecycle of scoping, managing and delivering an AI project. This hands-on training provides actionable AI innovation toolkits and teaches how to use them within a specific context, including a use case of your own.| The programme  is organised around the different dimensions of innovation instead of  around AI  because the specific context of an institution plays a  crucial factor in innovation  and a better connecting factor than an  unknown and often misunderstood scientific field like AI. However  because of the many prejudices  among novices in the domain of AI  and the wildly varying backgrounds   we will start with a compulsory module to introduce AI. Equally  we  include a final and compulsory “case study” module where the students  need to integrate what they have learnt  honing their holistic  understanding of AI and innovation  as well as their interdisciplinary  skills. These case studies will be published online and serve as  marketing materials. Please note that for the first edition of the program (February-June 2024)  only people with a degree from a Belgian university will be able to apply. For those with a degree from outside Belgium  applications will open in June 2024. The program has been developed for  professionals and recent graduates with an affinity for IT  and that are  directly or indirectly involved  or wish to be involved in innovation  with AI.

We pay attention to expressing these conclusions in a correct and understandable way.                               To emphasize the practical approach in this course all classes will take place in a pc room. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a statistical tool used in the comparison of means of a random variable over populations that differ in one or more characteristics (factors)  e.g. treatment  age  sex  subject  etc. First  we cover one-way ANOVA  where only one factor is of concern. Depending on the type of the factor  the conclusions pertain to just those factor levels included in the study (fixed factor model)  or to a population of factor levels of which we observed a sample (random effects model). In two-way and multi-way ANOVA where populations differ in more than one characteristic  the effects of factors are studied simultaneously. This yields information about the main effects of each of the factors as well as about any special joint effects (factorial design). We also consider nested designs  where each level of a second (mostly random) factor occurs in conjunction with only one level of the first factor. One special challenge in multi-way ANOVA lies in verifying the assumptions that must be satisfied. In this course we will focus on correct execution of data analysis and understanding its results. We pay attention to expressing these conclusions in a correct and understandable way. The different methods will be extensively illustrated with examples from scientific studies in a variety of fields. Exercises are worked out behind PC using the R software. Target audience This course targets professionals and investigators from diverse areas  who need to use statistical methods in the collection and handling of data in their research  in particular for assessing the effect of e.g. different treatments. Fees The participation fee is 1100 EUR for participants from the private sector. Reduced prices apply to students and staff from non-profit  social profit  and government organizations.

Tidyverse is a collection of R-packages used for data wrangling and visualization that share a common design philosophy. The goal of this course is to get you up to speed with the most up-to-date and essential tidyverse tools for data exploration. After attending this course  you’ll have the tools to tackle a wide variety of data wrangling and visualization challenges  using the best parts of R tidyverse. This course covers the most essential tools from 3 main R tidyverse packages that are frequently used in general data analysis procedure. Lectures with R code demonstrations are blended with hands-on exercises which allows you to try out the tools you’ve seen in the class under guides. What you will learn: Data transforming and summarizing with dplyr: narrowing in on observations of interest  creating new variables that are functions of existing variables  and calculating a set of summary statistics (like counts or means)Data visualization with ggplot2: creating more informative graphs (e.g.  scatter plot  bar plot  histogram  smoother/regression line  …) in an elegant and efficient way. Arranging multiple plots on a gridData ingest and tidying with tidyr: storing it in a consistent form that matches the semantics of the dataset with the way it is stored.Extra tools for programming: Merging and comparing two datasets based on various matching or filtering criterion. Other useful tools for R programming. Not included in this course: A systematic training guide in basics of R. If you never used R or RStudio before  we highly recommend you to take Module 2 of this year's program which will guide you to be familiar with the R environment for the implementation of data management and exploration tasks.Big data. This course focuses on small  in-memory datasets as you can’t tackle big data easily unless you have experience with small data.Statistics. Although you will see many basic statistics in this course  the main focus is on R and the tidyverse tools instead of explaining the statistical concepts. Target audience This course targets anyone who wants to use R for data processing and needs to produce professional looking graphs and/or summary statistics.

After attending this course  you’ll have the tools to tackle a wide variety of data wrangling and visualization challenges  using the best parts of R tidyverse. This course covers the most essential tools from 3 main R tidyverse packages that are frequently used in general data analysis procedure. Lectures with R code demonstrations are blended with hands-on exercises which allows you to try out the tools you’ve seen in the class under guides. What you will learn: Data transforming and summarizing with dplyr: narrowing in on observations of interest  creating new variables that are functions of existing variables  and calculating a set of summary statistics (like counts or means)Data visualization with ggplot2: creating more informative graphs (e.g.  scatter plot  bar plot  histogram  smoother/regression line  …) in an elegant and efficient way. Arranging multiple plots on a gridData ingest and tidying with tidyr: storing it in a consistent form that matches the semantics of the dataset with the way it is stored.Extra tools for programming: Merging and comparing two datasets based on various matching or filtering criterion. Other useful tools for R programming. Not included in this course: A systematic training guide in basics of R. If you never used R or RStudio before  we highly recommend you to take Module 2 of this year's program which will guide you to be familiar with the R environment for the implementation of data management and exploration tasks.Big data. This course focuses on small  in-memory datasets as you can’t tackle big data easily unless you have experience with small data.Statistics. Although you will see many basic statistics in this course  the main focus is on R and the tidyverse tools instead of explaining the statistical concepts. Target audience This course targets anyone who wants to use R for data processing and needs to produce professional looking graphs and/or summary statistics. Fees The participation fee is 495 EUR for participants from the private sector. Reduced prices apply to students and staff from non-profit  social profit  and government organizations. An exam fee of 35 EUR will be applied. Industry  private sector  profession*: € 495Non profit  government  higher education staff: € 370(Doctoral) students  unemployed: € 225 *If two or more employees from the same company enrol simultaneously for this course a reduction of 20% on the course fee is taken into account starting from the second enrolment.

Within the safety & security domain  it is a  challenge to inform individuals and organizations working together  around a common problem in such a way that activities can be developed. This means that sufficient information must be present to coordinate  activities  while access to information must be possible within the  network. Without these two conditions  it is impossible to address a  security threat or coordinate a crisis.  Those challenges create several issues regarding the coordination of  information  the integration of technology within and between  organizations and networks  the use of Generative Artificial  Intelligence to achieve better decision-making  etc. In this lecture   Mr. Chaara elaborates on these issues and tries to answer the challenges  posed.

Within the safety & security domain  it is a  challenge to inform individuals and organizations working together  around a common problem in such a way that activities can be developed. This means that sufficient information must be present to coordinate  activities  while access to information must be possible within the  network. Without these two conditions  it is impossible to address a  security threat or coordinate a crisis.  Those challenges create several issues regarding the coordination of  information  the integration of technology within and between  organizations and networks  the use of Generative Artificial  Intelligence to achieve better decision-making  etc. In this lecture   Mr. Chaara elaborates on these issues and tries to answer the challenges  posed.

Especially  we do not fully understand how ethical perceptions about AI influence both job applicants and the organizations that use AI for hiring purposes. In this session  we will discuss important aspects of using AI in hiring processes. First  we will discuss that AI is not created equally in terms of ethical perceptions. Indeed  people view the use of AI differently depending on what aspects of the hiring process it is used for (e.g.  analyzing CV vs. analyzing one’s social media). Then  we will discuss the influence of ethical perceptions of AI in hiring on the trust individuals put in organizations that use AI in hiring. We will focus on the importance individuals lend to AI performing its expected role  and how this expectation influences their ethical perceptions of AI  and in turn the trust they put on organizations using AI in hiring. Finally  we will further discuss whether and how ethical perceptions of using AI in hiring are related to individuals’ attraction to organizations that use AI in hiring. Circling back to the beginning of the session  we will discuss that the influence of ethical perceptions of using AI in hiring are not consistent across hiring methods. For example  only individuals who consider it ethical for organizations to use AI in intrusive ways  such as analyzing social media information for traits and characteristics  viewed such organizations as more attractive. |Ethical Perceptions of AI: How Does it Matter for Hiring?

Description R is a flexible environment for statistical computing and graphics  which is becoming increasingly popular as a tool to get insight in often complex data. While in some ways similar to other programming languages (such as C  Java and Perl)  R is particularly suited for data analysis because ready-made functions are available for a wide variety of statistical (classical statistical tests  linear and nonlinear modeling  timeseries analysis  classification  clustering  ...) and graphical techniques. The base R program can be extended with user-submitted packages  which means new techniques are often implemented in R before being available in other software. This is one of the reasons why R is becoming the de facto standard in certain fields such as bioinformatics (Bioconductor) and financial services. This course introduces the use of the R environment for the implementation of data management  data exploration  basic statistical analysis and automation of procedures. It starts with a description of the R GUI  the use of the command line and an overview of basic data structures. The application of standard procedures to import data or to export results to external files will be illustrated. Creation of new variables  subsetting  merging and stacking of data sets will be covered in the data management section. Exploration of the data by histograms  box plots  scatter plots  summary numbers  correlation coefficients and cross-tabulations will be performed. Simple statistical procedures that will be covered are: comparisons of observed group means (t-test  ANOVA and their non-parametric versions) and proportionstest for independence in 2-way cross tables and linear regression (focusing on the R-implementation of the statistical methods that are the subject of other modules of the statistics series)Finally  installing new packages and automation of analysis procedures will also be discussed. Practical sessions and specific exercises will be provided to allow participants to practice their R skills in interaction with the teacher.

The name comes from an acronym for BOunded HEight Matrices  of Integers  although the restriction to integers has been subsequently relaxed. The “height” of a vector is its infinity norm  and the “height” of a matrix A is the infinity norm of vec(A). The word “height” has been commonly used in the context of univariate polynomials expressed in the monomial basis: the height of a polynomial is the infinity norm of the vector of coefficients. We say “characteristic height” for the height of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix A. The idea is to restrict the study to families of matrices all of whose entries come from a finite (and hence bounded) set  called the population. Well-known examples include zero-one or binary matrices  Bernoulli matrices whose entries are either 1 or -1  and sign pattern matrices where the entries can be 1  0  or -1. One can then study Bohemian families of structured matrices  say upper Hessenberg Toeplitz Bohemian matrices  or complex symmetric tridiagonal Bohemian matrices  or symmetric matrices with entries from a restricted population  or Bohemian companion matrices  or other families. In this talk I will survey some known results  and discuss some problems that remain open. In particular  I will ask for help in finding algorithms to construct “minimal height” companion matrices for polynomials with integer coefficients; such things exist (possibly not uniquely) but there is no known good algorithm for constructing them. I will give examples where the height of the companion matrix is exponentially smaller (in the degree/dimension) than is the characteristic height. This seems interesting because lower height offers the hope of better eigenvalue conditioning. But even that is not well-understood. This is joint work with many people. |Bohemian Matrices: An introduction and some open problems  The name “Bohemian matrices” was proposed for a field that has actually been studied for many years now by different researchers  not recognizing their commonality.

Professionals in this domain, however, might struggle to keep up with the fast-paced developments in recent years. In particular, the recent and impressive emergence of neural networks in machine learning as a go-to paradigm has rapidly altered the state of the art in artificial intelligence and challenges existing computational approaches to text. This micro-credential has been carved out as a balanced selection of contemporary modules from the MA in Digital Text Analysis that targets industry professionals who are interested in learning about modern machine learning and natural language processing. With an emphasis on project and teamwork, we develop practical applications on textual data, as well as solutions for the many issues that remain open in the field.| This micro-credential focuses on the following learning outcomes. 1. The participant will have theoretical knowledge about the history and the main frameworks of Machine Learning. 2. The participant will have theoretical knowledge of the main machine learning algorithms and paradigms and will study some of them in depth. 3. The participant will be able to develop machine learning pipelines and set up their own machine learning experiments using Python modules. 4. The participant will have theoretical and practical knowledge of machine learning using neural networks. 5. The participant will understand the fundamental problems and approaches in automatic Natural Language Processing and know its history as a subfield within Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence. 6. The participant will have insight into the basic algorithms developed within NLP for morphological  syntactic  semantic  and discourse processing. 7. The participant will acquire hands-on experience with software for text categorization  language understanding  translation  and generation. This micro-credential is a targeted subset from the MA in Digital Text Analysis and singles a teaching track in natural language processing. None of the modules overlap in time  allowing students to engage at a reasonable pace  over the course of the first and second semester. All courses extensively rely on weekly  hands-on homework assignments  ensuring the acquisition of new  practical insights on a regular basis. The homework takes the form of engaging assignments on real-world datasets that challenge the students to apply the theoretical concept introduced during the interactive class sessions.The final evaluation of all three courses depends on project work  the goal and finality of which can be determined by the individual students  in close correspondence with the course teachers.An attractive feature of the evaluation of the NLP course (in the 2nd semester) is that students will participate in an ongoing shared task in the field.

It is meant to provide a place for the discussion of the most recent developments in optimisation in machine learning problems, and the exploration of new research directions in this field.| 13:00 - 13:40 Optimization of macro-at-k metrics in multi-label classification(Prof. dr. Krzysztof Dembczyński — Yahoo! Research  USA aned Poznań University of Technology  Poland) We consider a problem of optimizing macro-averaged complex performance metrics in multi-label classification  that is metrics linearly decomposable into a sum of binary classification utilities applied separately to each label. We focus on tasks in which the algorithm is required to predict exactly k labels for each instance  leading to macro-at-k metrics. The constraint couples the otherwise independent binary classification tasks  leading to a much more challenging optimization problem than standard macro-averages. We analyze the problem in two different statistical regimes  namely in the expected test utility (ETU) and the population utility (PU) frameworks. The former aims at optimizing the expected performance on a given test set  while the latter optimizes the performance on a population level. For both frameworks we derive optimal prediction rules and practical algorithmic solutions with provable statistical guarantees. Empirical results provide evidence for the competitive performance of the proposed approaches.   13:40 - 14:20 On extensions of loss minimisation for training uncertainty-aware predictors (Prof. dr. Eyke Hüllermeier — LMU Munich  Germany) Due to the steadily increasing relevance of machine learning for practical applications  many of which are coming with safety requirements  the notion of uncertainty has received increasing attention in machine learning research in the recent past. This talk will address questions and challenges regarding the representation and adequate handling of (predictive) uncertainty in (supervised) machine learning. A specific focus will be put on the distinction between two important types of uncertainty  often referred to as aleatoric and epistemic. In this regard  a recent generalisation of the common (empirical) loss minimisation approach in machine learning will be critically anaysed and shown to be fundamentally flawed.   14:20 - 15:00 Learning from user and environment in combinatorial optimisation (Prof. dr. ir. Tias Guns — KU Leuven  Belgium) Industry and society are increasingly automating processes  which requires solving combinatorial optimisation problems. To find not just optimal solutions  but also 'desirable' solutions for the end user  it is increasingly important to offer AI tools that automatically learn from the user and the environment and that support the constraint modelling in interpretable ways. In this talk I will provide an overview of three different ways in which AI can augment the modeling part of combinatorial optimisation. This includes learning from the user (preference learning in VRP)  learning from the environment (end-to-end decision focussed learning) and explanation generation  that sit at the intersection of learning and reasoning. As part of this work  we are building a modern constraint programming language called CPMpy(http://cpmpy.readthedocs.io) that eases integration of multiple constraint solving paradigms with machine learning and other scientific python libraries. I will shortly highlight its possibilities beyond the above cases  as well as our larger vision of conversational human-aware technology for optimisation.   16:00 - 18:00 Efficient algorithms for set-valued prediction in classification (Public PhD defence ir. Thomas Mortier — Ghent University)  In recent years  the use of machine learning has gained popularity in solving complex tasks across multiple domains  including robotics  healthcare  biology and finance. However  with the increasing amount of data and complexity of tasks  the notion of uncertainty has become of major importance in machine learning. The ability to represent uncertainty in an efficient and trustworthy way should therefore be considered as a key feature of any machine learning method. This thesis aims to address this challenge by focusing on the development of principled tools to efficiently represent uncertainty in machine learning. In particular  the concept of set-valued prediction is highlighted  which provides end-users with multiple answers instead of a single answer with little guarantee. To this end  probabilistic classification is considered  where the unknown relationship between inputs and classes is assumed to be non-deterministic and expressed by a conditional class distribution. A distinction between several settings in classification is made and different biological applications are considered  including large-scale bacterial species identification using Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) data. |Optimisation in Machine Learning  13:00 - 13:40 Optimization of macro-at-k metrics in multi-label classification(Prof. dr.

Many developers are facing this challenge  but since you're great self-learners you continuously improve your skills by reading blogs  coding  and collaborating with colleagues. However  navigating the vast amount of information available can be overwhelming  and the lack of a proper framework makes it challenging to interpret this information correctly. Additionally  there is a lot of misinformation out there  making it difficult to separate accurate information from incomplete  unclear  or misleading information. Since going back to school for a degree in AI may not be a practical option for many of you  as it can be too theoretical and not directly applicable to your work we want to explore a new learning technique with you: a single day of training where you focus on solving a concrete problem which provides a framework for learning new concrete AI techniques. The teaching material is oriented around very concrete hands-on programming challenges. Each challenge aims to explain a certain AI technique.

However  many models behave as black boxes that can hide data biases  incorrect hypotheses or even software errors. In this talk  Maria Rodriguez Martinez (IBM Zürich) illustrates how interpretable deep learning models can achieve both high prediction accuracy and transparency. First  she will introduce multi-modal deep learning models that predict drug response while highlighting the genetic and chemical patterns that were more informative to make a prediction. Rodriguez Martinez also discusses how reinforcement learning approaches can facilitate the early phases of drug discovery and support the personalized design of new candidate compounds. Focusing next on T cell-based immunotherapies  she presents a model to predict the binding of T cell receptors and epitopes. This model can be coupled with an easy-to-use interpretable pipeline to extract the binding rules governing the T cell binding. These approaches are a first step towards the design and engineering of receptors of improved affinity. Finally  she will briefly discuss how interpretable models enable the linkage of different data modalities  such as image and molecular data.

Artificial intelligence systems provide robotics application new impressive perspectives, but also come with complex challenges. https://www.vaia.be/en/courses/triple-helix-for-control-model-based-learning-and-embodied-intelligence#registrationForm New perspectives come with complex challenges Webinar-Online-VAIA &amp; KU Leuven ESAT Stadius"

Recent studies used reinforcement learning to solve challenging problems such as wind farm control, epidemic mitigation, and robot control.| Reinforcement learning concerns a distinct branch in the field of machine learning. While supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques learn based on a set of instances  reinforcement learning concerns an agent that learns by interacting with an environment. To illustrate this setting  consider a video game  where the agent identifies as the player of the game. The environment concerns the video game that can be controlled with a gamepad and observed by looking at the screen. The agent receives feedback from the environment in terms of rewards  for example via a game score. Based on this feedback and the observations of the environment  a reinforcement learning agent aims at learning to play the game optimally  by interacting repeatedly with the environment. In this course  we will study both the reinforcement learning problem and the algorithms that can be used to approach such problems. Over the last years  several important milestones were achieved using the reinforcement learning framework  such as learning to play ATARI 2600 video games  learning to play the board game Go to beat the number one human player and learning to reach grandmaster performance in the real-time strategy game Starcraft II. However  reinforcement learning is no longer limited to games  as many real-world problems can be formulated as a reinforcement learning problem. Recent studies used reinforcement learning to solve challenging problems such as wind farm control  epidemic mitigation  and robot control. In this course  we will convey the fundamentals that underlie reinforcement learning. To achieve this  we will start from intuition and applications to move towards formalisms that can implement a reinforcement learning agent. To move from formalisms to practice  we will explore these concepts in a grid-world environment using the python programming language. 10:00-12:00 Lecture13:00-15:00 Practical Session |A deep dive into reinforcement learning  Reinforcement learning concerns a distinct branch in the field of machine learning.

The renewed interest in the last years is because of its unique suitability for the newly emerged data-driven paradigm  specifically the representation-free perspective on dynamical systems as sets of trajectories.

In this course we focus on the techniques in Statistical disclosure control to minimize the amount of personal data in data sets.| Legitimacy of data-driven research and success of data-intensive applications depend on protecting privacy in the design  realisation  deployment and maintenance of these studies and systems. Personal Data Minimization (PDM) is a core principle of privacy protection  whereby the amount of personal data in data sets is adjusted to the level needed for the legitimate data usage in mind (i.e.  for the aimed study or system functionality).

Using a SDC tool  an expert can apply advanced SDC algorithms with proper parameters to a data set (i.e.  transform the data set)  gain insights into the utility of the original and the transformed data sets  estimate the data disclosure risks of the original and the transformed data sets  and eventually make appropriate trade-offs between the indicators of data utility and data disclosure risks.

Artificial intelligence and contract formation|https://www.vaia.be/en/courses/artificial-intelligence-and-contract-formation|19/10/2022|Conference-Leuven-KU Leuven|19 Oct 2022 09:00 - 17:20|English|Aula Arenbergkasteel and livestream|Target audience: Everybody||No|€130|https://www.law.kuleuven.be/apps/activiteiten/activities/5977#5977|Conference|Systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly present in our daily lives. Although these systems generally produce outstanding results, they are also imperfect, just like human beings. While the added value of these systems is that they are able to match or exceed human performance in a way that is both faster and cheaper, a fundamental challenge remains that it is impossible to rule out occasional incorrect results.| Consequently  the legal relevance of AI systems is growing rapidly  especially when these systems are used to support a party in the process of contract formation. This seminar focuses on four applications in which parties may consider an AI system’s analysis in the decision (not) to conclude a contract. To begin with  AI systems are increasingly being used to support due diligence in M&A transactions. In an HR context  these systems are relied upon to analyse resumes or employee performance. AI systems are used as a contracting tool in the banking and insurance sector as well  e.g. to quickly assess the situation and work out an appropriate settlement that the other party is likely to accept. Finally  these systems can also be used in the art sector to assess the authenticity of a piece of art. These applications can help support the work of lawyers and in-house counsel. However  because AI systems are not flawless  they can also give rise to disputes. The resolution of such disputes depends on the difficult assessment of whether a party was entitled to rely on the AI system in given situation  and on the identification of the relevant legal regime. To facilitate this analysis  lawyers  company lawyers and judges may benefit from a basic understanding of the advantages and legal challenges of the use of AI systems to support contract formation  which will be discussed during this seminar. 09:00 - 09:10 uur: Opening remarks Prof. dr.

While the added value of these systems is that they are able to match or exceed human performance in a way that is both faster and cheaper, a fundamental challenge remains that it is impossible to rule out occasional incorrect results. https://www.law.kuleuven.be/apps/activiteiten/activities/5977#5977 Conference Conference-Leuven-KU Leuven

The  workshop covers three topics: Implementing AI in Control RoomsPredictive AnalyticsBusiness Integration (managerial focus) By Francesco Corman - Chair of Transport Systems at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology  ETH Zurich We review different challenges and opportunities for traffic control  in railway systems. From the point of view of sensing  state estimation  and data fusion must be performed in a very short time  and for units  that are typically spatially dispersed. From the point of view of  determining a control objective to support automatic decisions  the  challenge is how to understand the impact of a decision in terms of  system performance. Almost all of those problems have to deal with  unknown future states  which must be predicted  typically by model-based  or black box approaches  also based on advanced analytics. Once an  objective function and optimization variables are determined   optimization models can help to find a solution quickly and effectively.  Further challenges are the acceptance of decision stakeholders  within  the control room  but also within the travelers and operators  or the  direct implementation of automatic digital control. For  passenger-oriented traffic control  this is particularly interesting and  challenging  due to the large amount of possible decisions per decision  maker  and data that can partially describe those aspects  which calls  for machine learning approaches. To reach all those goals  the system  must have room for control  in another sense  flexibility in operations  must be built in already from the planning  to be exploited in the  real-time horizon when needed. by Leon Sobrie - On Track Lab Digitisation and employee workload (im)balance are intertwined. To address undesirable workload peaks and lows  we propose a 2-step machine learning model to provide real-time workload analytics per controller in digital safety-critical control rooms. The advocated model leverages a rich real-time data structure with disaggregated event-level taskload data. Next to exploring different machine and deep learning approaches  we compare the performance of a model that predicts aggregate workload with the performance of the aggregate of different models that predict specific task loads. We develop a business application that utilizes the proposed model to provide detailed predictive analytics that open the black box of workload imbalance and  in this way  empowers the control room manager with real-time insights. by Christophe Hurter - ENAC The Decision Making Process is already associated with AI. The algorithms are meant to help ATCOs in daily tasks  but they still face acceptability issues. Today’s automation systems with AI/Machine Learning do not provide additional information on top of the Data Processing result to support its explanation  making them not transparent enough.

EUROCONTROL recognized these needs when publishing its white papers on Resilience Engineering almost 15 years ago. The project called “Weak Signal” continued on that side. Besides the theoretical foundation on weak signals definition  detection and management  one of this project’s outputs is the development of a novel tool called SECA (Structured Exploration of Complex Adaptations). SECA helps detecting weak signals in normal air traffic management operations  creating shared organizational knowledge. This latter arises from a collaborative elicitation process that span from tacit and explicit dimensions.

The various scientific theories form a factual basis for modelling the processes. We can understand these often adaptive mechanisms through causal relations and causal pathways  which we can model as networks. Using this theoretical framework and the software provided  students can easily simulate a variety of scenarios.During the second week  students will carry out activities that could lay the foundations for a publication that can be finished later on in the course.This course introduces a network-oriented modelling approach based on adaptive networks. This approach is useful for modelling social interactions and mental and health-related processes within their respective networks.These network models cover the dynamics of causal effects  changing causal connections and excitability or sensitivity thresholds. Higher-order adaptiveness is another topic covered in the course  which includes the role of metaplasticity and the extent to which plasticity occurs in the field of cognitive neuroscience.Assessment is based on the assignments.

In a nutshell  Libratus is a decision-making agent that takes decisions in an uncertain environment  exploring the potential consequences of their own choices using complex estimates of the world around. This course is a study of the basic building blocks of decision-making agents  which are abstract entities living in an uncertain environment and are guided towards the realisation of given objectives. An agent is typically endowed with a knowledge base  a collection of facts expressed in some logical language  and an action repertoire at each state. The agent can reason about the environment  using their knowledge base  and take decisions accordingly. The environment is typically unknown  stochastic  and evolves following some rules that might be unknown to the agent  as well. On top of this  it is usually inhabited by other agents  which may or may not strive to achieve similar objectives. The task is to take the best possible decision that can be taken given the (incomplete) information available.

The proposed AI Act classifies the application of AI in employment and management as a high-risk area  due to their potential impact on “career prospects and livelihoods of workers” by “perpetuating historical patterns of discrimination”. However  recent expositions of algorithmic management in warehouses and online platforms show that concerns about AI in the workplace should extend beyond career prospects and livelihoods into job quality and worker wellbeing. In this paper  we review the existing evidence on AI’s potential effects – both positive and negative – on current job quality trends  using Eurofound’s seven-dimensional job quality framework. |The impact of AI on job quality: need for enlarged regulatory scope?

Given an image-caption pair  the goal is to extract a shared hierarchical structure for both image and language simultaneously. We argue that such structured output  grounded in both modalities  is a clear step towards the high-level understanding of multimodal information. Besides challenges existing in conventional visually grounded grammar induction tasks  VL grammar induction requires a model to capture contextual semantics and perform a fine-grained alignment. To address these challenges  we propose a novel method  CLIORA  which constructs a shared vision-language constituency tree structure with context-dependent semantics for all possible phrases in different levels of the tree. It computes a matching score between each constituent and image region  trained via contrastive learning. It integrates two levels of fusion  namely at feature-level and at score-level  so as to allow fine-grained alignment. We introduce a new evaluation metric for VL grammar induction  CCRA  and show a 3.3% improvement over a strong baseline on Flickr30k Entities. We also evaluate our model via two derived tasks  i.e.  language grammar induction and phrase grounding  and improve over the state-of-the-art for both. Authors: Bo Wan (Speaker)  Wenjuan Han  Zilong Zheng  Tinne Tuytelaars In recent years  we have seen significant steps taken in the development of self-driving cars.

These systems can sometimes give the impression that full self-driving is just around the corner and that we would soon build cars without even a steering wheel. The increase in the level of autonomy and control given to an AI provides an opportunity for new modes of human-vehicle interaction. However  surveys have shown that giving more control to an AI in self-driving cars is accompanied by a degree of uneasiness by passengers. In an attempt to alleviate this issue  recent works have taken a natural language-oriented approach by allowing the passenger to give commands that refer to specific objects in the visual scene. Nevertheless  this is only half the task as the car should also understand the physical destination of the command  which is what we focus on in this paper. We propose an extension in which we annotate the 3D destination that the car needs to reach after executing the given command and evaluate multiple different baselines on predicting this destination location.

Each of the major course modules will be briefly introduced and motivated. 2 : Security & Privacy (S&P) Engineering and Regulations (4 April  14-17.30h) Module 2A The covering of S&P requirements is a matter of running a significant security project  albeit efficiently. There is no such thing as the ultimate approach  but rather a range of measures and activities that can be applied to strengthen the S&P posture. This can be at the level of requirements and specification  at the level of coding  in security testing  etc. This module will cover the overall landscape and zoom into some of the most promising techniques. Relevant themes of this session include: Threat modelling and risk assessmentArchitectures and blueprintsRegulations and complianceModule 2B Security and privacy requirements are typically not only of a technical nature  they also and largely emerge from the demand to be compliant with policies and regulations. In the second module of Security & Privacy Engineering  we zoom into the most relevant regulations and discuss how we can work towards compliance. In addition  we discuss how this concern can be addressed as an integrated part of the overall development and engineering process.Z 3 : Cryptography: basic & advanced techniques (5 April  10-13h) Many protection techniques and technologies are at hand. It goes without saying that cryptography is an essential building block at the heart of data protection  and thus essential for the delivery of S&P requirements. The machine learning pipeline needs protection of training data  production data and models. This challenging environment demands for fairly advanced techniques.

This type of splitting arises when the datasets from different sources cannot be aggregated on one single machine or when the available machines are of different powers. A de-biased estimator of the precision matrix on every single machine is proposed  and theoretical guarantees are provided. Moreover  a new de-biased estimator that is pooled across the machines using a composite likelihood approach is proposed. It is shown to enjoy consistency and asymptotic normality  and we provide statistical inference strategies based on it. The performance of this estimator is investigated via simulation studies and real data exam- ples. It is shown that the performance of this estimator is close to the non-distributed estimator  which uses the entire dataset. 12:00–1:00 pmon-campus (KU Leuven Faculty of Economics and Business HOGM 01.85) or online via Zoom (https://us02web.zoom.us/j/88418552909?pwd=MERhSDAvSVdET0xKWnpFOUxHOVJMUT09)24 February 2022 Elia Lapenta (ENSAE Paris) “Nonparametric instrumental variable estimation without smoothing on the instruments”  We propose a new estimation method for nonparametric models identified by Instru- mental Variables (IVs). The estimation is based on a class of Generically Comprehensively Revealing functions. Compared to methods available in the literature that smooth on the IVs  our estimation does not smooth on the instruments and thus requires the selection of less tun- ing parameters. Furthermore  it does not suffer from a curse of dimensionality on the IVs. We show that our procedure is equivalent to a classical estimation method that smooths on the Ivs but keeps the bandwidth fixed as the sample size increases.  We then extend our methodology to estimate a partly linear model with endogenous variables. We obtain convergence rates for the estimator of the nonparametric part of the model and the asymptotic normality of the estimator of the parametric components. To deal with the ill- posedness of the inverse problem  we use a Landweber-Friedman regularization. This has the advantage of being a simple iterative method that avoids the inversion of a large matrix whose dimension increases with the sample size. We finally study the implementation of our proce- dure and propose a data-driven selection of the regularization and the smoothing parameters.

A clustering algorithm should be able  despite of this heterogene- ity  to extract discriminant pieces of information from the variables in order to design groups. In this work we introduce a multilayer architecture model-based clustering method called Mixed Deep Gaussian Mixture Model (MDGMM) that can be viewed as an automatic way to merge the clustering performed separately on continuous and non-continuous data. This architecture is flexible and can be adapted to mixed as well as to continuous or non-continuous data. In this sense we generalize Generalized Linear Latent Variable Models and Deep Gaussian Mixture Models. We also design a new initialisation strategy and a data driven method that selects the best specification of the model and the optimal number of clusters for a given dataset “on the fly”. Besides  our model provides continuous low-dimensional representations of the data which can be a useful tool to visualize mixed datasets. Finally  we validate the performance of our approach comparing its results with state-of-the-art mixed data clustering models over several commonly used datasets.12:00–1:00 pmonline10 March 2022 Cavit Pakel (Bilkent University) “Bounds on average effects in discrete choice panel data models”  Average effects in discrete choice panel data models with individual-specific fixed effects are generally only partially identified in short panels. While consistent estimation of the identified set is possible  it generally requires very large sample sizes  especially when the number of support points of the observed covariates is large  such as when the covariates are continuous. In this paper  we propose estimating outer bounds on the identified set of average effects. Our bounds are easy to construct  converge at the parametric rate  and are computationally simple to obtain even in moderately large samples  independent of whether the covariates are discrete or continuous. We also provide asymptotically valid confidence intervals on the identified set. Simulation studies confirm that our approach works well and is informative in finite samples. We also consider an application to labor force participation.

In addition  we use the bootstrap to generate plausible synthetic samples of data not seen in historical real data to create statistics of interest pertaining to uncertainty. While our approach is generic we focus on robust portfolio allocation problems as an application and study the impact of risk versus uncer- tainty in a dynamic mean-variance setting. We show that a mean-variance optimizing investor achieves economically meaningful wealth gains (33%) across our sample from 1996-2019 by internalizing our uncertainty measure during portfolio formation.

In this talk  we will address post-selection inference through approximate maximum likelihood estimation. Our goal is to: (i) efficiently utilize hold-out information from selection with the aid of randomization  (ii) bypass expensive MCMC sampling from exact conditional distri- butions that are hard to evaluate in closed forms. At the core of our new method is the solution to a convex optimization problem which assumes a separable form across multiple learning queries during selection. We illustrate the potential of our method across wide-ranging values of signal-to-noise ratio in simulated experiments. 12:00–1:00 pm  online31 March 2022 Limin Peng (Emory University) “Heterogeneous individual risk modeling of recurrent events”  Progression of chronic disease is often manifested by repeated occurrences of disease-related events over time. Delineating the heterogeneity in the risk of such recurrent events can provide valuable scientific insight for guiding customized disease management. In this paper  we propose a new sensible measure of individual risk of recurrent events and present a dynamic modeling framework thereof  which accounts for both observed covariates and unobservable frailty. The proposed modeling requires no distributional specification of the unobservable frailty  while permitting the exploration of dynamic effects of the observed covari- ates. We develop estimation and inference procedures for the proposed model through a novel adaptation of the principle of conditional score. The asymptotic properties of the proposed es- timator  including the uniform consistency and weak convergence  are established. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate satisfactory finite-sample performance of the proposed method. We illustrate the practical utility of the new method via an application to a diabetes clinical trial that explores the risk patterns of hypoglycemia in Type 2 diabetes patients. 5:00–6:00 pm  online21 April 2022 Angelo Guevara (Universidad de Chile) “Endogeneity in discrete choice models”  Endogeneity is the most severe failure that a discrete choice model can face in its objective of making causal inference or forecasting. It occurs when the explanatory variables are not independent of the error term and results in inconsistent estimators of the model pa- rameters. This seminar summarizes the causes  impact  and state of the art methods to detect and to address endogeneity in discrete choice models  which are related  but differ in relevant aspects  from those of linear model. The emphasis is put on providing the theoretical funda- mentals and the intuition behind the problems that may arise  as well as practical details as on how to apply the methods to address them  stressing the main considerations that must be taken in this endeavor. The main concepts are formally stated  and references are given to specific recent articles for further details that may be required for advanced applications or a deeper understanding. The seminar begins providing details on the definition  impact  causes and examples of endogeneity in discrete choice models  followed by a revision of possible approaches to detect this problem. Then  a deep review of the fundamentals  intuition and practicalities of the various methods that can be used to address endogeneity is presented  followed by a section providing insights and methods related to the obtention and validation of instrumental variables  which are key in this effort. The seminar continues then revising the problem of forecasting with discrete choice models that have been corrected for endogeneity  finalizing with a summary of the main conclusions and takeaways. 5:00–6:00 pmonline28 April 2022 Cécile Adam (KU Leuven) “Local linear functional mean regression under censoring”  Among the main interests in regression analysis is to explore the influence that a functional has on a real-valued variable of interest  the response. There is some literature on flexible mean regression  in which the targeted quantity is the conditional mean of the response given the functional. Another interest in statistics is to study the regression under the condition of censoring in which the values of the response are only partially known. After an introduc- tion to mean regression function estimation in which the response variable is subject to right random censorship  different statistical methodology are presented. The finite-sample perfor- mance of the estimators is investigated via a simulation study. (Joint work with I. Gijbels and G. Claeskens.) 12:00–1:00 pm  on campus 5 May 2022 Wiktor Budzinski (University of Warsaw) “Hybrid choice models vs. endogeneity of indicator variables: a Monte Carlo investigation”  We investigate the problem of endogeneity in the context of hybrid choice (integrated choice and latent variable) models. We first provide a thorough analysis of potential causes of endogeneity and propose a working taxonomy. We demonstrate that although it is widely believed that the hybrid choice framework is devoid of the endogeneity problem  there is no theoretical reason to expect that this is the case. We then demonstrate empirically that the problem exists in the hybrid choice framework too. By conducting a Monte Carlo experiment  we display the extent of the bias resulting from measurement and endogeneity biases. Finally  we propose two novel solutions to address the problem: by explicitly accounting for correlation between structural and discrete choice component error terms (or with random parameters in a utility function)  or by introducing additional latent variables. Using simulated data  we demonstrate that these approaches work as expected  that is  they result in unbiased estimates of all model parameters. 12:00–1:00 pm online12 May 2022 Wendun Wang (Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam) “Recovering spillover structures with structural breaks in panel data models”  This paper aims at capturing time-varying spillover effects in a panel data setting. We consider panel models where the outcome of a unit not only depends on own characteristics and also the characteristics of other units (spillover effects). The effect of own characteristics can be unit-specific or homogeneous (common effects). We allow the spillover structure  i.e.  which units interact with which  to be latent  and the structure and effect of spillovers may both vary over time. We model time-varying spillovers via structural breaks with unknown break points. To estimate the break points  spillover and common effects  we solve a penalized least squares optimization and employ double machine learning procedures to improve the conver- gence and inference. We establish the super consistency of the estimated break point and provide the convergence rate of estimated spillover and common effects. We illustrate the theory via simulated and empirical data. 12:00–1:00 pm on-campus19 May 2022 Thierry Magnac (Toulouse School of Economics) “Linear models with interval-censored explanatory variables”  This paper studies the problem of inference in a set identified problem defined by linear moment restrictions with interval-censored variables. It introduces a novel and tractable inference procedure based on characterizing the identified set of the coefficient of interest in terms of the solution to convex optimization problems with equality constraints. Monte Carlo experiments evaluate the numerical performance of the novel inference procedure and compare it with existing ones.12:00–1:00 pm on-campus "|"Statistics and Econometrics Seminars  17 February 2022 Eugen Pircalabelu (UCLouvain) ""Unbalanced distributed estimation and inference for (covariate-adjusted) Gaussian graphical models”A distributed estimation and statistical inference framework is introduced for the sparse precision matrix in the (covariate-adjusted) Gaussian graphical models under the un- balanced splitting setting.

We obtain convergence rates for the estimator of the nonparametric part of the model and the asymptotic normality of the estimator of the parametric components. To deal with the ill- posedness of the inverse problem  we use a Landweber-Friedman regularization. This has the advantage of being a simple iterative method that avoids the inversion of a large matrix whose dimension increases with the sample size. We finally study the implementation of our proce- dure and propose a data-driven selection of the regularization and the smoothing parameters.

A clustering algorithm should be able  despite of this heterogene- ity  to extract discriminant pieces of information from the variables in order to design groups. In this work we introduce a multilayer architecture model-based clustering method called Mixed Deep Gaussian Mixture Model (MDGMM) that can be viewed as an automatic way to merge the clustering performed separately on continuous and non-continuous data. This architecture is flexible and can be adapted to mixed as well as to continuous or non-continuous data. In this sense we generalize Generalized Linear Latent Variable Models and Deep Gaussian Mixture Models. We also design a new initialisation strategy and a data driven method that selects the best specification of the model and the optimal number of clusters for a given dataset “on the fly”. Besides  our model provides continuous low-dimensional representations of the data which can be a useful tool to visualize mixed datasets. Finally  we validate the performance of our approach comparing its results with state-of-the-art mixed data clustering models over several commonly used datasets.12:00–1:00 pmonline10 March 2022 Cavit Pakel (Bilkent University) “Bounds on average effects in discrete choice panel data models”  Average effects in discrete choice panel data models with individual-specific fixed effects are generally only partially identified in short panels. While consistent estimation of the identified set is possible  it generally requires very large sample sizes  especially when the number of support points of the observed covariates is large  such as when the covariates are continuous. In this paper  we propose estimating outer bounds on the identified set of average effects. Our bounds are easy to construct  converge at the parametric rate  and are computationally simple to obtain even in moderately large samples  independent of whether the covariates are discrete or continuous. We also provide asymptotically valid confidence intervals on the identified set. Simulation studies confirm that our approach works well and is informative in finite samples. We also consider an application to labor force participation.

In addition  we use the bootstrap to generate plausible synthetic samples of data not seen in historical real data to create statistics of interest pertaining to uncertainty. While our approach is generic we focus on robust portfolio allocation problems as an application and study the impact of risk versus uncer- tainty in a dynamic mean-variance setting. We show that a mean-variance optimizing investor achieves economically meaningful wealth gains (33%) across our sample from 1996-2019 by internalizing our uncertainty measure during portfolio formation.

In this talk  we will address post-selection inference through approximate maximum likelihood estimation. Our goal is to: (i) efficiently utilize hold-out information from selection with the aid of randomization  (ii) bypass expensive MCMC sampling from exact conditional distri- butions that are hard to evaluate in closed forms. At the core of our new method is the solution to a convex optimization problem which assumes a separable form across multiple learning queries during selection. We illustrate the potential of our method across wide-ranging values of signal-to-noise ratio in simulated experiments. 12:00–1:00 pm  online31 March 2022 Limin Peng (Emory University) “Heterogeneous individual risk modeling of recurrent events”  Progression of chronic disease is often manifested by repeated occurrences of disease-related events over time. Delineating the heterogeneity in the risk of such recurrent events can provide valuable scientific insight for guiding customized disease management. In this paper  we propose a new sensible measure of individual risk of recurrent events and present a dynamic modeling framework thereof  which accounts for both observed covariates and unobservable frailty. The proposed modeling requires no distributional specification of the unobservable frailty  while permitting the exploration of dynamic effects of the observed covari- ates. We develop estimation and inference procedures for the proposed model through a novel adaptation of the principle of conditional score. The asymptotic properties of the proposed es- timator  including the uniform consistency and weak convergence  are established. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate satisfactory finite-sample performance of the proposed method. We illustrate the practical utility of the new method via an application to a diabetes clinical trial that explores the risk patterns of hypoglycemia in Type 2 diabetes patients. 5:00–6:00 pm  online21 April 2022 Angelo Guevara (Universidad de Chile) “Endogeneity in discrete choice models”  Endogeneity is the most severe failure that a discrete choice model can face in its objective of making causal inference or forecasting. It occurs when the explanatory variables are not independent of the error term and results in inconsistent estimators of the model pa- rameters. This seminar summarizes the causes  impact  and state of the art methods to detect and to address endogeneity in discrete choice models  which are related  but differ in relevant aspects  from those of linear model. The emphasis is put on providing the theoretical funda- mentals and the intuition behind the problems that may arise  as well as practical details as on how to apply the methods to address them  stressing the main considerations that must be taken in this endeavor. The main concepts are formally stated  and references are given to specific recent articles for further details that may be required for advanced applications or a deeper understanding. The seminar begins providing details on the definition  impact  causes and examples of endogeneity in discrete choice models  followed by a revision of possible approaches to detect this problem. Then  a deep review of the fundamentals  intuition and practicalities of the various methods that can be used to address endogeneity is presented  followed by a section providing insights and methods related to the obtention and validation of instrumental variables  which are key in this effort. The seminar continues then revising the problem of forecasting with discrete choice models that have been corrected for endogeneity  finalizing with a summary of the main conclusions and takeaways. 5:00–6:00 pmonline28 April 2022 Cécile Adam (KU Leuven) “Local linear functional mean regression under censoring”  Among the main interests in regression analysis is to explore the influence that a functional has on a real-valued variable of interest  the response. There is some literature on flexible mean regression  in which the targeted quantity is the conditional mean of the response given the functional. Another interest in statistics is to study the regression under the condition of censoring in which the values of the response are only partially known. After an introduc- tion to mean regression function estimation in which the response variable is subject to right random censorship  different statistical methodology are presented. The finite-sample perfor- mance of the estimators is investigated via a simulation study. (Joint work with I. Gijbels and G. Claeskens.) 12:00–1:00 pm  on campus 5 May 2022 Wiktor Budzinski (University of Warsaw) “Hybrid choice models vs. endogeneity of indicator variables: a Monte Carlo investigation”  We investigate the problem of endogeneity in the context of hybrid choice (integrated choice and latent variable) models. We first provide a thorough analysis of potential causes of endogeneity and propose a working taxonomy. We demonstrate that although it is widely believed that the hybrid choice framework is devoid of the endogeneity problem  there is no theoretical reason to expect that this is the case. We then demonstrate empirically that the problem exists in the hybrid choice framework too. By conducting a Monte Carlo experiment  we display the extent of the bias resulting from measurement and endogeneity biases. Finally  we propose two novel solutions to address the problem: by explicitly accounting for correlation between structural and discrete choice component error terms (or with random parameters in a utility function)  or by introducing additional latent variables. Using simulated data  we demonstrate that these approaches work as expected  that is  they result in unbiased estimates of all model parameters. 12:00–1:00 pm online12 May 2022 Wendun Wang (Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam) “Recovering spillover structures with structural breaks in panel data models”  This paper aims at capturing time-varying spillover effects in a panel data setting. We consider panel models where the outcome of a unit not only depends on own characteristics and also the characteristics of other units (spillover effects). The effect of own characteristics can be unit-specific or homogeneous (common effects). We allow the spillover structure  i.e.  which units interact with which  to be latent  and the structure and effect of spillovers may both vary over time. We model time-varying spillovers via structural breaks with unknown break points. To estimate the break points  spillover and common effects  we solve a penalized least squares optimization and employ double machine learning procedures to improve the conver- gence and inference. We establish the super consistency of the estimated break point and provide the convergence rate of estimated spillover and common effects. We illustrate the theory via simulated and empirical data. 12:00–1:00 pm on-campus19 May 2022 Thierry Magnac (Toulouse School of Economics) “Linear models with interval-censored explanatory variables”  This paper studies the problem of inference in a set identified problem defined by linear moment restrictions with interval-censored variables. It introduces a novel and tractable inference procedure based on characterizing the identified set of the coefficient of interest in terms of the solution to convex optimization problems with equality constraints. Monte Carlo experiments evaluate the numerical performance of the novel inference procedure and compare it with existing ones.12:00–1:00 pm on-campus  More info  Share this course   https://www.vaia.be/nl/opleidingen/statistics-and-econometrics-seminars 17 Feb 2022 - 19 May 2022 seminars-KU Leuven; ORSTAT (Faculty of Economics and Business) &amp; Statistics Research Group (Faculty of Science)"
