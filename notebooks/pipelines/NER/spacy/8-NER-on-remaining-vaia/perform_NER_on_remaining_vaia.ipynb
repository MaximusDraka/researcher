      "61 The control room of the future  AI empowered dashboards  A special focus will be given to control rooms as this sector is  increasing in importance with the digitization of operations The  workshop covers three topics Implementing AI in Control RoomsPredictive AnalyticsBusiness Integration managerial focus By Francesco Corman  Chair of Transport Systems at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology  ETH Zurich We review different challenges and opportunities for traffic control  in railway systems From the point of view of sensing  state estimation  and data fusion must be performed in a very short time  and for units  that are typically spatially dispersed From the point of view of  determining a control objective to support automatic decisions  the  challenge is how to understand the impact of a decision in terms of  system performance Almost all of those problems have to deal with  unknown future states  which must be predicted  typically by modelbased  or black box approaches  also based on advanced analytics Once an  objective function and optimization variables are determined   optimization models can help to find a solution quickly and effectively  Further challenges are the acceptance of decision stakeholders  within  the control room  but also within the travelers and operators  or the  direct implementation of automatic digital control For  passengeroriented traffic control  this is particularly interesting and  challenging  due to the large amount of possible decisions per decision  maker  and data that can partially describe those aspects  which calls  for machine learning approaches To reach all those goals  the system  must have room for control  in another sense  flexibility in operations  must be built in already from the planning  to be exploited in the  realtime horizon when needed by Leon Sobrie  On Track Lab Digitisation and employee workload imbalance are intertwined To address undesirable workload peaks and lows  we propose a 2step machine learning model to provide realtime workload analytics per controller in digital safetycritical control rooms The advocated model leverages a rich realtime data structure with disaggregated eventlevel taskload data Next to exploring different machine and deep learning approaches  we compare the performance of a model that predicts aggregate workload with the performance of the aggregate of different models that predict specific task loads We develop a business application that utilizes the proposed model to provide detailed predictive analytics that open the black box of workload imbalance and  in this way  empowers the control room manager with realtime insights by Christophe Hurter  ENAC The Decision Making Process is already associated with AI The algorithms are meant to help ATCOs in daily tasks  but they still face acceptability issues Today’s automation systems with AIMachine Learning do not provide additional information on top of the Data Processing result to support its explanation  making them not transparent enough The Decision Making Process is expected to become a “White Box”  giving understandable outcome through an

      "116 Statistics and Econometrics Seminars  17 February 2022 Eugen Pircalabelu UCLouvain Unbalanced distributed estimation and inference for covariateadjusted Gaussian graphical models”A distributed estimation and statistical inference framework is introduced for the sparse precision matrix in the covariateadjusted Gaussian graphical models under the un balanced splitting setting This type of splitting arises when the datasets from different sources cannot be aggregated on one single machine or when the available machines are of different powers A debiased estimator of the precision matrix on every single machine is proposed  and theoretical guarantees are provided Moreover  a new debiased estimator that is pooled across the machines using a composite likelihood approach is proposed It is shown to enjoy consistency and asymptotic normality  and we provide statistical inference strategies based on it The performance of this estimator is investigated via simulation studies and real data exam ples It is shown that the performance of this estimator is close to the nondistributed estimator  which uses the entire dataset 1200–100 pmoncampus KU Leuven

variable estimation without smoothing on the instruments”  We propose a new estimation method for nonparametric models identified by Instru mental Variables IVs The estimation is based on a class of Generically Comprehensively Revealing functions Compared to methods available in the literature that smooth on the IVs  our estimation does not smooth on the instruments and thus requires the selection of less tun ing parameters Furthermore  it does not suffer from a curse of dimensionality on the IVs We show that our procedure is equivalent to a classical estimation method that smooths on the Ivs but keeps the bandwidth fixed as the sample size increases  We then extend our methodology to estimate a partly linear model with endogenous variables We obtain convergence rates for the estimator of the nonparametric part of the model and the asymptotic normality of the estimator of the parametric components To deal with the ill posedness of the inverse problem  we use a LandweberFriedman regularization This has the advantage of being a simple iterative method that avoids the inversion of a large matrix whose dimension increases with the sample size We finally study the implementation of our proce dure and propose a datadriven selection of the regularization and the smoothing parameters Joint work with JeanPierre Florens 1200–100 pmoncampus KU Leuven room HOGM

challenges inherent to the very heteroge neous nature of the variables A clustering algorithm should be able  despite of this heterogene ity  to extract discriminant pieces of information from the variables in order to design groups In this work we introduce a multilayer architecture modelbased clustering method called Mixed Deep Gaussian Mixture Model MDGMM that can be viewed as an automatic way to merge the clustering performed separately on continuous and noncontinuous data This architecture is flexible and can be adapted to mixed as well as to continuous or noncontinuous data In this sense we generalize Generalized Linear Latent Variable Models and Deep Gaussian Mixture Models We also design a new initialisation strategy and a data driven method that selects the best specification of the model and the optimal number of clusters for a given dataset “on the fly” Besides  our model provides continuous lowdimensional representations of the data which can be a useful tool to visualize mixed datasets Finally  we validate the performance of our approach comparing its results with stateoftheart mixed data clustering models over several commonly used datasets1200–100

fixed effects are generally only partially identified in short panels While consistent estimation of the identified set is possible  it generally requires very large sample sizes  especially when the number of support points of the observed covariates is large  such as when the covariates are continuous In this paper  we propose estimating outer bounds on the identified set of average effects Our bounds are easy to construct  converge at the parametric rate  and are computationally simple to obtain even in moderately large samples  independent of whether the covariates are discrete or continuous We also provide asymptotically valid confidence intervals on the identified set Simulation studies confirm that our approach works well and is informative in finite samples We also consider an application to labor force participation Joint work with Martin Weidner 1200–100 pmonline17 March 2022 Eric Ghysels University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill “Ambiguity with machine learning an application to portfolio choice”  To characterize ambiguity we use machine learning to impose guidance and dis cipline on the formulation of expectations in a datarich environment In addition  we use the bootstrap to generate plausible synthetic samples of data not seen in historical real data to create statistics of interest pertaining to uncertainty While our approach is generic we focus on robust portfolio allocation problems as an application and study the impact of risk versus uncer tainty in a dynamic meanvariance setting We show that a meanvariance optimizing investor achieves economically meaningful wealth gains 33 across our sample from 19962019 by internalizing our uncertainty measure during portfolio formation Joint work with Yan Qian and Steve Raymond 1200–100 pm

to ensure valid inferences after model selection some of these are easy to compute  while others fare better in terms of inferen tial power In this talk  we will address postselection inference through approximate maximum likelihood estimation Our goal is to i efficiently utilize holdout information from selection with the aid of randomization  ii bypass expensive MCMC sampling from exact conditional distri butions that are hard to evaluate in closed forms At the core of our new method is the solution to a convex optimization problem which assumes a separable form across multiple learning queries during selection We illustrate the potential of our method across wideranging values of signaltonoise ratio in simulated experiments 1200–100 pm  online31 March 2022 Limin Peng Emory University “Heterogeneous individual risk modeling of recurrent events”  Progression of chronic disease is often manifested by repeated occurrences of diseaserelated events over time Delineating the heterogeneity in the risk of such recurrent events can provide valuable scientific insight for guiding customized disease management In this paper  we propose a new sensible measure of individual risk of recurrent events and present a dynamic modeling framework thereof  which accounts for both observed covariates and unobservable frailty The proposed modeling requires no distributional specification of the unobservable frailty  while permitting the exploration of dynamic effects of the observed covari ates We develop estimation and inference procedures for the proposed model through a novel adaptation of the principle of conditional score The asymptotic properties of the proposed es timator  including the uniform consistency and weak convergence  are established Extensive simulation studies demonstrate satisfactory finitesample performance of the proposed method We illustrate the practical utility of the new method via an application to a diabetes clinical trial that explores the risk patterns of hypoglycemia in Type 2 diabetes patients 500–600 pm  online21 April 2022 Angelo Guevara Universidad de Chile “Endogeneity in discrete choice models”  Endogeneity is the most severe failure that a discrete choice model can face in its objective of making causal inference or forecasting It occurs when the explanatory variables are not independent of the error term and results in inconsistent estimators of the model pa rameters This seminar summarizes the causes  impact  and state of the art methods to detect and to address endogeneity in discrete choice models  which are related  but differ in relevant aspects  from those of linear model The emphasis is put on providing the theoretical funda mentals and the intuition behind the problems that may arise  as well as practical details as on how to apply the methods to address them  stressing the main considerations that must be taken in this endeavor The main concepts are formally stated  and references are given to specific recent articles for further details that may be required for advanced applications or a deeper understanding The seminar begins providing details on the definition  impact  causes and examples of endogeneity in discrete choice models  followed by a revision of possible approaches to detect this problem Then  a deep review of the fundamentals  intuition and practicalities of the various methods that can be used to address endogeneity is presented  followed by a section providing insights and methods related to the obtention and validation of instrumental variables  which are key in this effort The seminar continues then revising the problem of forecasting with discrete choice models that have been corrected for endogeneity  finalizing with a summary of the main conclusions and takeaways 500–600 pmonline28 April 2022 Cécile Adam KU Leuven “Local linear functional mean regression under censoring”  Among the main interests in regression analysis is to explore the influence that a functional has on a realvalued variable of interest  the response There is some literature on flexible mean regression  in which the targeted quantity is the conditional mean of the response given the functional Another interest in statistics is to study the regression under the condition of censoring in which the values of the response are only partially known After an introduc tion to mean regression function estimation in which the response variable is subject to right random censorship  different statistical methodology are presented The finitesample perfor mance of the estimators is investigated via a simulation study Joint work with I Gijbels and G Claeskens 1200–100 pm  on campus 5 May 2022 Wiktor Budzinski University of Warsaw “Hybrid choice models vs endogeneity of indicator variables a Monte Carlo investigation”  We investigate the problem of endogeneity in the context of hybrid choice integrated choice and latent variable models We first provide a thorough analysis of potential causes of endogeneity and propose a working taxonomy We demonstrate that although it is widely believed that the hybrid choice framework is devoid of the endogeneity problem  there is no theoretical reason to expect that this is the case We then demonstrate empirically that the problem exists in the hybrid choice framework too By conducting a Monte Carlo experiment  we display the extent of the bias resulting from measurement and endogeneity biases Finally  we propose two novel solutions to address the problem by explicitly accounting for correlation between structural and discrete choice component error terms or with random parameters in a utility function  or by introducing additional latent variables Using simulated data  we demonstrate that these approaches work as expected  that is  they result in unbiased estimates of all model parameters 1200–100 pm online12 May 2022 Wendun Wang Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam “Recovering spillover structures with structural breaks in panel data models”  This paper aims at capturing timevarying spillover effects in a panel data setting We consider panel models where the outcome of a unit not only depends on own characteristics and also the characteristics of other units spillover effects The effect of own characteristics can be unitspecific or homogeneous common effects We allow the spillover structure  ie  which units interact with which  to be latent  and the structure and effect of spillovers may both vary over time We model timevarying spillovers via structural breaks with unknown break points To estimate the break points  spillover and common effects  we solve a penalized least squares optimization and employ double machine learning procedures to improve the conver gence and inference We establish the super consistency of the estimated break point and provide the convergence rate of estimated spillover and common effects We illustrate the theory via simulated and empirical data 1200–100 pm oncampus19 May 2022 Thierry Magnac Toulouse School of Economics “Linear models with intervalcensored explanatory variables”  This paper studies the problem of inference

      "136 Bohemian Matrices An introduction and some open problems  The name “Bohemian matrices” was proposed for a field that has actually been studied for many years now by different researchers  not recognizing their commonality The name comes from an acronym for BOunded HEight Matrices  of Integers  although the restriction to integers has been subsequently relaxed The “height” of a vector is its infinity norm  and the “height” of a matrix A is the infinity norm of vecA The word “height” has been commonly used in the context of univariate polynomials expressed in the monomial basis the height of a polynomial is the infinity norm of the vector of coefficients We say “characteristic height” for the height of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix A The idea is to restrict the study to families of matrices all of whose entries come from a finite and hence bounded set  called the population Wellknown examples include zeroone or binary matrices  Bernoulli matrices whose entries are either 1 or 1  and sign pattern matrices where the entries can be 1  0  or 1 One can then study Bohemian families of structured matrices  say upper Hessenberg Toeplitz Bohemian matrices  or complex symmetric tridiagonal Bohemian matrices  or symmetric matrices with entries from a restricted population  or Bohemian companion matrices  or other families In this talk I will survey some known results  and discuss some problems that remain open In particular  I will ask for help in finding algorithms to construct “minimal height” companion matrices for polynomials with integer coefficients such things exist possibly not uniquely but there is no known good algorithm for constructing them I will give examples where the height of the companion matrix is exponentially smaller in the degreedimension than is the characteristic height This seems interesting because lower height offers the hope of better eigenvalue conditioning But even that is not wellunderstood This is joint work with many people  The name “Bohemian matrices” was proposed for a field that has actually been studied for many years now by different researchers not recognizing their commonality The name comes from an acronym for BOunded HEight Matrices of Integers although the restriction to integers has been subsequently relaxed httpshomesesatkuleuvenbesistawwwbdmbacktotherootsindexphpseminars Seminar by Robert M Corless seminarHeverlee LeuvenKU Leuven ESAT STADIUS\n",

      "163 Optimisation in Machine Learning  1300  1340 Optimization of macroatk metrics in multilabel classificationProf dr Krzysztof Dembczyński — Yahoo Research  USA aned Poznań University of Technology  Poland We consider a problem of optimizing macroaveraged complex performance metrics in multilabel classification  that is metrics linearly decomposable into a sum of binary classification utilities applied separately to each label We focus on tasks in which the algorithm is required to predict exactly k labels for each instance  leading to macroatk metrics The constraint couples the otherwise independent binary classification tasks  leading to a much more challenging optimization problem than standard macroaverages We analyze the problem in two different statistical regimes  namely in the expected test utility ETU and the population utility PU frameworks The former aims at optimizing the expected performance on a given test set  while the latter optimizes the performance on a population level For both frameworks we derive optimal prediction rules and practical algorithmic solutions with provable statistical guarantees Empirical results provide evidence for the competitive performance of the proposed approaches   1340  1420 On extensions of loss minimisation for training uncertaintyaware predictors Prof dr Eyke Hüllermeier — LMU Munich  Germany Due to the steadily increasing relevance of machine learning for practical applications  many of which are coming with safety requirements  the notion of uncertainty has received increasing attention in machine learning research in the recent past This talk will address questions and challenges regarding the representation and adequate handling of predictive uncertainty in supervised machine learning A specific focus will be put on the distinction between two important types of uncertainty  often referred to as aleatoric and epistemic In this regard  a recent generalisation of the common empirical loss minimisation approach in machine learning will be critically anaysed and shown to be fundamentally flawed   1420  1500 Learning from user and environment in combinatorial optimisation Prof dr ir Tias Guns — KU Leuven  Belgium Industry and society are increasingly automating processes  which requires solving combinatorial optimisation problems To find not just optimal solutions  but also desirable solutions for the end user  it is increasingly important to offer AI tools that automatically learn from the user and the environment and that support the constraint modelling in interpretable ways In this talk I will provide an overview of three different ways in which AI can augment the modeling part of combinatorial optimisation This includes learning from the user preference learning in VRP  learning from the environment endtoend decision focussed learning and explanation generation  that sit at the intersection of learning and reasoning As part of this work  we are building a modern constraint programming language called CPMpyhttpcpmpyreadthedocsio that eases integration of multiple constraint solving paradigms with machine learning and other scientific python libraries I will shortly highlight its possibilities beyond the above cases  as well as our larger vision of conversational humanaware technology for optimisation   1600  1800 Efficient algorithms for setvalued prediction in classification Public PhD defence ir Thomas Mortier — Ghent University  In recent years  the use of machine learning has gained popularity in solving complex tasks across multiple domains  including robotics  healthcare  biology and finance However  with the increasing amount of data and complexity of tasks  the notion of uncertainty has become of major importance in machine learning The ability to represent uncertainty in an efficient and trustworthy way should therefore be considered as a key feature of any machine learning method This thesis aims to address this challenge by focusing on the development of principled tools to efficiently represent uncertainty in machine learning In particular  the concept of setvalued prediction is highlighted  which provides endusers with multiple answers instead of a single answer with little guarantee To this end  probabilistic classification is considered  where the unknown relationship between inputs and classes is assumed to be nondeterministic and expressed by a conditional class distribution A distinction between several settings in classification is made and different biological applications are considered  including largescale bacterial species identification using Matrix Assisted Laser DesorptionIonisation TimeOfFlight Mass Spectrometry MALDITOF MS data  The goal of this smallscale minisymposium is to bring together researchers interested in the topic of optimisation in machine learning It is meant to provide a place for the discussion of the most recent developments in
