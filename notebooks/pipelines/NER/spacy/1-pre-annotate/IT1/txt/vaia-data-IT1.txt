Structural equation modeling with lavaan    Introduction to the theory and application of structural equation modeling and handling missing data  nonnormal data  categorical data  etc                               Structural equation modeling SEM is a general statistical modeling technique to study the relationships among observed and latent variables It spans a wide range of multivariate methods including path analysis  mediation analysis  confirmatory factor analysis  growth curve modeling  and many more Many applications of SEM can be found in the social  economic  behavioral and health sciences  but the technology is increasingly used in disciplines like biology  neuroscience and operation research SEM is often used to test theories or hypotheses that can be represented by a path diagram In a path diagram  observed variables are depicted by boxes  while latent variables hypothetical constructs measured by multiple indicators are depicted by circles Hypothesized possibly causal effects among these variables are represented by singleheaded arrows If you had ever found yourself drawing a path diagram in order to get a better overview of the complex interrelations among some key variables in your data  this course is for you The first day of the course provides an introduction to the theory and application of structural equation modeling  and illustrates how to use the opensource R package lavaan’ see httpslavaanorg to conduct an SEM analysis On the second day  we discuss several special topics that are often needed by applied users handling missing data  nonnormal data  categorical data  longitudinal data  multilevel data  etc With the exception of a short practical session at the end of the first day  the two days are mostly lectures  to maximize the amount of information that we can teach However  doityourself practicals with written feedback and solutions will be made available and illustrate all the topics that are covered in this course Target audience This course targets everyone with an interest in testing theories or models that involve relationships between both observed and latent variables The audience for this course can include both novices with little or no previous experience with SEM  as well as existing users who wish to refresh or update their theoretical and practical understanding of structural equation modeling Fees The participation fee is 750 EUR for participants from the private sector Reduced prices apply to students and staff from nonprofit  social profit  and government organizations An exam fee of 35 EUR will be applied Industry  private sector  profession € 750Non profit  government  higher education staff € 565Doctoral students  unemployed € 340 If two or more employees from the same company enrol simultaneously for this course a reduction of 20 on the course fee is taken into account starting from the second enrolment Registration More information and registration on our BetaAcademy website  Introduction to the theory and application of structural equation modeling and handling missing data nonnormal data categorical data etc httpsbetaacademyugentbeenprogramshortandlongrunninginitiatives202320242024m13emmodule13structuralequation Structural equation modeling courseGhentUGent
A NoCode Approach to Decision Support and Knowledge Capturing  In their daytoday operations  companies typically make many small but important decisions  such as  which employee should handle an incoming requestwhich service should be recommended to a specific customerhow should a specific product be configured to meet a customers requirement whether a specific customer is entitled to a discount  etc  Decision  support systems can help employees make these decisions faster  more  reliably and more consistently  reducing costs and increasing confidence  in the process To develop such systems  blackbox AI methods such as  deep learning are not wellsuited  because they lack the required  transparency and explainability A more promising approach are  knowledgebased AI systems  which derive their intelligence not from  data  but from logical models of rules  regulations and expert  knowledge In this workshop  you will get to know the  stateoftheart IDP knowledgebase system  developed at KU Leuven It  is currently being used by companies in the manufacturing httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkpPe0GRjifE  financial httpsyoutubeZzsy4MtdWBE  and legal sectors to provide various decision support  both to their  customers and inhouse This system is based on methods and techniques  that were developed for declarative programming systems such as Prolog   but it offers a number of important innovations 1 instead of focusing  only on querying  the IDP system provides a wide range of different  functionalities that can be used to implement rich interactive  interfaces that support users in different workflows  2 instead of  relying on programmers  the system allows its end users to maintain the  underlying knowledge base  which means that we can cut out the middle  man of IT staff and allow the business experts themselves to update the  system  thereby not only reducing cost and turnaround time but also  putting the ownership of the decision knowledge in the right hands The  workshop starts with a brief introduction to Knowledgebased AI and  presents existing applications in the financial and manufacturing  sectors We then proceed with a handson tutorial  using a freely  available web interface that participants access from their own laptops  In this workshop you will get to know the stateoftheart IDP  knowledgebase system that has been developed at KU Leuven and is  currently used by companies in various sectors You will be able to build basic applications using IDP and you will be able to identify potential use cases for this technology httpspuckuleuvenbenlopleiding6kjpeqerb3gbx7zo Workshop workshopBruggeKU Leuven Postuniversitair Centrum VAIA
