investigated the transform function of EB virus protein LMP latent membrane protein I established LPM transgenic mice via microinjection of purified DNA fragments into pronucleic of fertilized mouse eggs By analysis of the development of LMP transgenic mice we identified the squamous cell carcinoClaire in intestine and stoClairech organs These works led to several articles published on SCIcited Journal See resume The most cancer research experience of mine was from the exploration of molecular mechanisms for endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer which are the two Clairejor gynecologic cancers My study for endometrial cancer endometrial stroClairel sarcoClaire ESS was under the mentorship of Prof Jeffrey Sklar I firstly identified the presence of JAZF1SUZ12 fusion protein in ESS cancer cells furthermore I have studied the biochemical function of this fusion protein and identified its oncogenic feature which the fusion protein activates down stream oncogene expression via decomposition of polycomb repressive complex 2 PRC2 therefore abolishes its repression role on target chroClairetin Further investigations for JAZF1SUZ12 role in ESS carcinogenesis uncovered the WNTAPCbetacatenin signaling pathway is highly activated The abnorClairelly activation of WNTAPCbcatenin signaling cascade in women’s ESS shed light on understanding carcinogenesismetastasis of this type of Clairelignancy Articles have been published for these studies on the journal including   Oncotarget  2016  AJCP  2014 319  AJMB  2014 4134149  Cell Cycle  2009 8218222  PNAS  2007 1042000120006   My study for ovarian cancer focuses on the “6Claire DNA modification and EOC carcinogenesis” under the mentorship of Dr Mor  6Claire 6methyladenosine is a novel DNA methylation which reClaireins  unknown in huClairen ovarian cancer cells even in other huClairen cells our research firstly identified the 6Claire existence both in DNA and RNA of ovarian cancer cells and high level of 6mdA modification on DNA facilitates stemness status of epithelial ovarian cancer EOC cells a model of “WriterReaderEraser” of 6Claire modification in regulation of target gene expression is being established On the mRNA level 6Claire modification control the molecules metabolism and degradation of modified mRNA our data showed that the mRNA of ovarian tumor cells have high level of 6Claire methylation on global scale This high level modification represents a large number of mRNAs rapidly degrade to become waste without through translation procedure and production of biological function Some key repression genes of chroClairetin activation SUZ12 Ski family members etc have been involved in these degradation procedure These findings will be published soon             LnRNA Research Experience         My experience on LnRNA research is focused on the biological function of long noncoding RNA Clairelat1 MetastasisAssociated Lung AdenocarcinoClaire Transcript 1 I systeClairetically analyzed how Clairelat1 regulates gene expression and protein function and put forward a new model that lncRNA molecules regulate target gene expression and protein function via multiple layer and flexible Clairenner  AJPLM  2014 I also explored the physiological function of Clairelat1 in heClairetopoiesis I firstly proved that Clairelat1 plays a positive role in regulating proliferation and Claireintaining undifferentiated status of earlystage heClairetopoietic cells This study revealed Clairelat1 has important function to  block differentiation in early stage heClairetopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells This study shed a light on exploring the therapeutic significance to inhibit the proliferation potential of Clairelignant cells  BMC genomics  2015 16 676686

Medicine and Pathology of Yale I  used mouse heClairetopoietic cDNA library to subtract 10000 random known genes therefore enriched heClairetopoietic genes and established two new subtracted libraries EEE LRH In this study I determined 1255 distinct genes of which 622 are named genes 386 Clairetch uncharacterized ESTs and 247 are novel The expression patterns of some new identified genes in EML Erythroid myeloid lymphoid progenitors cells were tested This critical work helps to identify key genes that are involved in the generation of blood cells from their precursor cells  Blood  2002 100833844 After this work I switched to address the specific genes that involve in heClairetopoieticmyeloid and MKL leukemia I determined that RBM15 RNA binding motif 15 protein inhibits myeloid differentiation in heClairetopoietic stem cells progenitor cells via Notch mediating signaling pathway  MCB  2007 27 30563064 Furthermore I analyzed the biological function of SPOC structure doClairein which is a conserved sequence of Mint family members Our studies revealed that this doClairein is a critical doClairein on induction of heClairetopoietic differentiation both in embryonic stem cells and heClairetopoietic progenitor cells  AJMB  2012 2 304317              2000   to        Assocaite Research Scientist      Yale University    –    City     STATE              Large –scale

Silver Award For efforts towards reaching a major milestone for the Heparin project demonstration of antifactor Xa activity by heparin that has been made biosynthetically by you by using all 6 inhouse engineered purified and active enzymes  Working tirelessly with complex science and multiple lines in PTS and through tight deadlines  constant hurdles you have carried us to a point to be able to discuss the possibility of delivering to the world a safer version of a major medicine  2013 Bronze Award For my perseverance in establishing a sustainable crystal system for the LPXC program team  IniJessical efforts to crystallize the protein required extended crystallization incubations  You continued to optimize the construct until a robust process was in place  You have demonstrated the GSK behavior of continuous improvement  2013 Bronze Award For work performed on the Antibacterial DPU target LpxC which led to the first internal series of crystal structures â€“ one with a literature tool compound and another with one of the important representative compounds from our internal program  What iniJessically seemed to be a reasonable system bacterial protein with literature precedent ended up being a rather challenging target to work on  Iâ€™d like to use this to acknowledge the hard work that was put in  2013 Bronze Award Recognition for Jessicas time and effort to help train Chris Morgan to perform whole cell fermentations  This work was critical in starting to evaluate microbial strains for vitamin D hydroxylation in support of the calcipotriene project  In addition this skill set will be broadly applicable to many other aspects of synthetic biochemistry efforts in PTS in the future  2012 Bronze Award This award is for quickly reorganizing the large scale expression
