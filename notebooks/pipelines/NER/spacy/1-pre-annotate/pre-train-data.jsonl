{"text": "A deep dive into reinforcement learning  Reinforcement learning concerns a distinct branch in the field of machine learning While supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques learn based on a set of instances  reinforcement learning concerns an agent that learns by interacting with an environment To illustrate this setting  consider a video game  where the agent identifies as the player of the game The environment concerns the video game that can be controlled with a gamepad and observed by looking at the screen The agent receives feedback from the environment in terms of rewards  for example via a game score Based on this feedback and the observations of the environment  a reinforcement learning agent aims at learning to play the game optimally  by interacting repeatedly with the environment In this course  we will study both the reinforcement learning problem and the algorithms that can be used to approach such problems Over the last years  several important milestones were achieved using the reinforcement learning framework  such as learning to play ATARI 2600 video games  learning to play the board game Go to beat the number one human player and learning to reach grandmaster performance in the realtime strategy game Starcraft II However  reinforcement learning is no longer limited to games  as many realworld problems can be formulated as a reinforcement learning problem Recent studies used reinforcement learning to solve challenging problems such as wind farm control  epidemic mitigation  and robot control In this course  we will convey the fundamentals that underlie reinforcement learning To achieve this  we will start from intuition and applications to move towards formalisms that can implement a reinforcement learning agent To move from formalisms to practice  we will explore these concepts in a gridworld environment using the python programming language 10001200 Lecture13001500 Practical Session  Reinforcement learning is no longer limited to games as many realworld problems can be formulated as a reinforcement learning problem Recent studies used reinforcement learning to solve challenging problems such as wind farm control epidemic mitigation and robot control httpswwwflamesstatisticscomiucourses64 Using reinforcement learning to solve challenging real world problems CourseBrusselsVAIA amp Flames"}

workshop covers three topics Implementing AI in Control RoomsPredictive AnalyticsBusiness Integration managerial focus By Francesco Corman  Chair of Transport Systems at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology  ETH Zurich We review different challenges and opportunities for traffic control  in railway systems From the point of view of sensing  state estimation  and data fusion must be performed in a very short time  and for units  that are typically spatially dispersed From the point of view of  determining a control objective to support automatic decisions  the  challenge is how to understand the impact of a decision in terms of  system performance Almost all of those problems have to deal with  unknown future states  which must be predicted  typically by modelbased  or black box approaches  also based on advanced analytics Once an  objective function and optimization variables are determined   optimization models can help to find a solution quickly and effectively  Further challenges are the acceptance of decision stakeholders  within  the control room  but also within the travelers and operators  or the  direct implementation of automatic digital control For  passengeroriented traffic control  this is particularly interesting and  challenging  due to the large amount of possible decisions per decision  maker  and data that can partially describe those aspects  which calls  for machine learning approaches To reach all those goals  the system  must have room for control  in another sense  flexibility in operations  must be built in already from the planning  to be exploited in the  realtime horizon when needed by Leon Sobrie  On Track Lab Digitisation and employee workload imbalance are intertwined To address undesirable workload peaks and lows  we propose a 2step machine learning model to provide realtime workload analytics per controller in digital safetycritical control rooms The advocated model leverages a rich realtime data structure with disaggregated eventlevel taskload data Next to exploring different machine and deep learning approaches  we compare the performance of a model that predicts aggregate workload with the performance of the aggregate of different models that predict specific task loads We develop a business application that utilizes the proposed model to provide detailed predictive analytics that open the black box of workload imbalance and  in this way  empowers the control room manager with realtime insights by Christophe Hurter  ENAC The Decision Making Process is already associated with AI The algorithms are meant to help ATCOs in daily tasks  but they still face acceptability issues Today\u2019s automation systems with AIMachine Learning do not provide additional information on top of the

distributed estimation and statistical inference framework is introduced for the sparse precision matrix in the covariateadjusted Gaussian graphical models under the un balanced splitting setting This type of splitting arises when the datasets from different sources cannot be aggregated on one single machine or when the available machines are of different powers A debiased estimator of the precision matrix on every single machine is proposed  and theoretical guarantees are provided Moreover  a new debiased estimator that is pooled across the machines using a composite likelihood approach is proposed It is shown to enjoy consistency and asymptotic normality  and we provide statistical inference strategies based on it The performance of this estimator is investigated via simulation studies and real data exam ples It is shown that the performance of this estimator is close to the nondistributed estimator  which uses the entire dataset 1200\u2013100 pmoncampus KU Leuven

requires the selection of less tun ing parameters Furthermore  it does not suffer from a curse of dimensionality on the IVs We show that our procedure is equivalent to a classical estimation method that smooths on the Ivs but keeps the bandwidth fixed as the sample size increases  We then extend our methodology to estimate a partly linear model with endogenous variables We obtain convergence rates for the estimator of the nonparametric part of the model and the asymptotic normality of the estimator of the parametric components To deal with the ill posedness of the inverse problem  we use a LandweberFriedman regularization This has the advantage of being a simple iterative method that avoids the inversion of a large matrix whose dimension increases with the sample size We finally study the implementation of our proce dure and propose a datadriven selection of the regularization and the smoothing parameters Joint work with JeanPierre Florens 1200\u2013100 pmoncampus KU Leuven room

presents numerous challenges inherent to the very heteroge neous nature of the variables A clustering algorithm should be able  despite of this heterogene ity  to extract discriminant pieces of information from the variables in order to design groups In this work we introduce a multilayer architecture modelbased clustering method called Mixed Deep Gaussian Mixture Model MDGMM that can be viewed as an automatic way to merge the clustering performed separately on continuous and noncontinuous data This architecture is flexible and can be adapted to mixed as well as to continuous or noncontinuous data In this sense we generalize Generalized Linear Latent Variable Models and Deep Gaussian Mixture Models We also design a new initialisation strategy and a data driven method that selects the best specification of the model and the optimal number of clusters for a given dataset \u201con the fly\u201d Besides  our model provides continuous lowdimensional representations of the data which can be a useful tool to visualize mixed datasets Finally  we validate the performance of our approach comparing its results with stateoftheart mixed data clustering models over several

panel data models with individualspecific fixed effects are generally only partially identified in short panels While consistent estimation of the identified set is possible  it generally requires very large sample sizes  especially when the number of support points of the observed covariates is large  such as when the covariates are continuous In this paper  we propose estimating outer bounds on the identified set of average effects Our bounds are easy to construct  converge at the parametric rate  and are computationally simple to obtain even in moderately large samples  independent of whether the covariates are discrete or continuous We also provide asymptotically valid confidence intervals on the identified set Simulation studies confirm that our approach works well and is informative in finite samples We also consider an application to labor force participation Joint work with Martin Weidner 1200\u2013100 pmonline17 March 2022 Eric Ghysels University of North Carolina

to uncertainty While our approach is generic we focus on robust portfolio allocation problems as an application and study the impact of risk versus uncer tainty in a dynamic meanvariance setting We

likelihood\u201d  Several strategies have been developed recently to ensure valid inferences after model selection some of these are easy to compute  while others fare better in terms of inferen tial power In this talk  we will address postselection inference through approximate maximum likelihood estimation Our goal is to i efficiently utilize holdout information from selection with the aid of randomization  ii bypass expensive MCMC sampling from exact conditional distri butions that are hard to evaluate in closed forms At the core of our new method is the solution to a convex optimization problem which assumes a separable form across multiple learning queries during selection We illustrate the potential of our method across wideranging values of signaltonoise ratio in simulated

by repeated occurrences of diseaserelated events over time Delineating the heterogeneity in the risk of such recurrent events can provide valuable scientific insight for guiding customized disease management In this paper  we propose a new sensible measure of individual risk of recurrent events and present a dynamic modeling framework thereof  which accounts for both observed covariates and unobservable frailty The proposed modeling requires no distributional specification of the unobservable frailty  while permitting the exploration of dynamic effects of the observed covari ates We develop estimation and inference procedures for the proposed model through a novel adaptation of the principle of conditional score The asymptotic properties of the proposed es timator  including the uniform consistency and weak convergence  are established Extensive simulation studies demonstrate satisfactory finitesample performance of the proposed method We illustrate the practical utility of

forecasting It occurs when the explanatory variables are not independent of the error term and results in inconsistent estimators of the model pa rameters This seminar summarizes the causes  impact  and state of the art methods to detect and to address endogeneity in discrete choice models  which are related  but differ in relevant aspects  from those of linear model The emphasis is put on providing the theoretical funda mentals and the intuition behind the problems that may arise  as well as practical details as on how to apply the methods to address them  stressing the main considerations that must be taken in this endeavor The main concepts are formally stated  and references are given to specific recent articles for further details that may be required for advanced applications or a deeper understanding The seminar begins providing details on the definition  impact  causes and examples of endogeneity in discrete choice models  followed by a revision of possible approaches to detect this problem Then  a deep review of the fundamentals  intuition and practicalities of the various methods that can be used to address endogeneity is presented  followed by a section providing insights and methods related to the obtention and validation of instrumental variables  which are key in this effort The seminar continues then revising the problem of forecasting

investigation\u201d  We investigate the problem of endogeneity in the context of hybrid choice integrated choice and latent variable models We first provide a thorough analysis of potential causes of endogeneity and propose a working taxonomy We demonstrate that although it is widely believed that the hybrid choice framework is devoid of the endogeneity problem  there is no theoretical reason to expect that this is the case We then demonstrate empirically that the problem exists in the hybrid choice framework too By conducting a Monte Carlo experiment  we display the extent of the bias resulting from measurement and endogeneity biases Finally  we propose two novel solutions to address the problem by explicitly accounting for correlation between structural and discrete choice component error terms or with random parameters in a utility function  or by introducing additional latent variables Using simulated data  we demonstrate that these approaches work as expected  that is  they result in unbiased estimates of all model parameters 1200\u2013100 pm online12 May 2022 Wendun Wang Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam \u201cRecovering spillover structures with structural breaks in panel data models\u201d  This paper aims at capturing timevarying spillover effects in a panel data setting We consider panel models where the outcome of a unit not only depends on own

which units interact with which  to be latent  and the structure and effect of spillovers may both vary over time We model timevarying spillovers via structural breaks with unknown break points To estimate the break points  spillover and common effects  we solve a penalized least squares optimization and employ double machine learning procedures to improve the conver gence and inference We

Compared to traditional statistics  the absence of a focus on scientific hypotheses  and the need for easily leveraging detailed signals in the data require a different set of models  tools  and analytical reflexes. This course aims to bring participants to the level where they can independently tackle the analytical part of data mining projects. This means that the most common types of projects will be addressed - regression-type with continuous outcomes  classification with categorical outcomes  and clustering. For each of these  the practical use of a set of standard methods will be shown  like Random Forests  Gradient Boosting Machines  Support Vector Machines  k-Nearest-Neighbors  K-means ... Furthermore  throughout the course  concepts will be highlighted that are of concern in every statistical learning applications  like the curse of dimensionality  model capacity  overfitting and regularization  and practical strategies will be offered to deal with them  introducing techniques such as the Lasso and ridge regression  cross-validation  bagging and boosting. Instructions will also be given on a selection of specific techniques that are often of interest  such as modern visualization of high-dimensional data  model calibration  outlier detection using isolation forests  explanation of black-box models ... Finally  the last lecture will introduce the idea of deep learning as a powerful tool for data analysis  discussing when and how to practically use it  and when to shy away from it.

{"text": "Current Trends in AI  Advanced GenAI (17 April 2024  12.30-15.30h) Dr. Thomas Winters These  days  we are surrounded by creative text and image generators like GPT  and diffusion models that seem to be able to generate anything we want.  But how do we ensure that these types of AI truly aid us in overcoming  our unique challenges? This talk sheds light on several techniques for  controlling such generative models. We look at several powerful prompt  engineering techniques \u2013 the art of enhancing our communication with AI \u2013  and useful ways of connecting these generators to other systems. We  dive into the world of autoregressive text generators  learn their inner  mechanisms and which training phases they went through to get to the  current state-of-the-art text generators. These insights help us  understand why certain prompt engineering techniques (such as few-shot  prompting  role-prompting and chain-of-thought prompting) are able to  outperform simpler prompting methods. We also briefly look at several  other techniques to overcome the limitations of such models  such as  retrieval-augmented generation and function calling. Similarly  we  uncover the workings of diffusion models and show several techniques to  gain more control over the generated images. We show how even some of  AI's classic hard problems  such as humour generation  become even more  within reach thanks to these large language models and their prompt  engineering techniques.

Sharing &  exchanging data  harvesting insights  driving innovation  fostering  integration  and revolutionizing data exploration  knowledge graphs pave  the way for transformative discoveries and understanding. In this seminar  the following topic will be tackled: Introduction to knowledge graphsSemantic Web basics: RDFFrom raw data to knowledge graphs with [R2]RMLUnlocking insights with querying through SPARQL MLOps (25 April 2024  12.30-15.30h) Prof. Mathias Verbeke and drs. Lara Luys One  of the main challenges for industry today is to get machine learning  models out of the proof-of-concept phase and into production. This is  not an easy task since data in production is not static  due to which  the model performance can degrade over time. Machine learning operations  or MLOps is a paradigm that aims to address this problem. Being a  contraction of Machine Learning and DevOps  MLOps focuses on developing  and maintaining machine learning models in production. This includes  training  evaluating as well as monitoring the model. In this seminar   the MLOps pipeline and the underlying principles will be explained   illustrated by means of a number of tools that can be used in the MLOps  process. AI@Edge (25 April 2024  16.00-19.00h) Prof. Hans Hallez and drs. Gregory De Ruyter Edge  Computing has been proven to be an optimised way to delegate  computation from the cloud towards the devices where the sensing takes  place. Edge computing on embedded devices mostly limits itself towards  compression  filtering or other basic analysis. Recent trends also show  that devices near the edge of the sensor network are capable of machine  learning algorithms. In this session  we will explore different  techniques to bring machine learning towards the edge network and deploy  these algorithms. First  we will give an overview of what embedded  devices are  and how we can perform machine learning at these devices  both in inference and in training. Second  we will give a hands-on  demonstration as an inspiration of how machine learning at the edge can  be implemented.  The world of artificial intelligence evolves at an astonishing speed. For those working with AI on a daily basis, staying up to date with the newest techniques within various domains is a challenge.

We will then discuss how technologies are often designed  in a way that threatens our digital well-being  and which strategies can  be used to improve digital well-being. This session will provide  attendees with the tools and knowledge they need to create ethical  technology that is designed with people at its core. Session 6: Ethical topics and dilemmas \u2013 Thursday 30 May 2024 This session will explore the application of behaviorist principles in  digital technologies  particularly in the realm of surveillance. It will  highlight how these technologies not only observe but actively  influence and modify user behavior  raising important ethical questions  about privacy  autonomy  and the power dynamics between users and  technology providers. The session will emphasize the need for ethical  guidelines to address the challenges posed by digital surveillance. This  session further examines the various functions fairness and equality  hold in the AI governance debate. Drawing from political philosophical  theories of justice and practical use-cases  a relational perspective on  AI is developed to understand better the social and technical dynamics  that give rise to digital injustice. This session will provide attendees  with an understanding of the ethical challenges that can arise in the  digital world  and the tools and frameworks that can be used to address  them. Session 7: Legal and policy issues \u2013 Thursday 6 June 2024  This session will explore a number of legal issues that arise in the  digital realm. This session will first provide attendees with an  understanding of appropriate legal frameworks related to the free flow  of information  (personal) data protection  and the principles  rights  and obligations of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  This session will also provide a comprehensive review of the impact AI  may have on individual and collective human rights across various  sectors. The participants will learn about the technical legal  instruments at their disposal to combat AI discrimination  including  legal tools related to direct and indirect discrimination  as well as  discrimination by association. Moreover  participants will be invited to  critically reflect on the resilience of ethics in the context of AI.  This approach to AI will consider high-level legal instruments within  the European Union  such as the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights  the  proposed AI Act  and the set of equality directives. A comparative law  approach will also be mobilized to provide a better understanding of  addressing AI challenges with traditional legal instruments. Session 8: Ethics in data and visualisation \u2013 Thursday 13 June 2024  In this session  we will discuss the ethical aspects of handling and  visualising of data. We will start by examining how data are  'constructed' and therefore are inherently 'biased'  rather than  representing an objective truth. We cross over to understand the value  of visualising data  acknowledging its potential risk to yet further  objectify this constructed  situated nature of data. We then dive into  how some data visualisations can be (unintentionally) perceived as  unethical  whether through potentially misleading design choices  the  use of dubious data  the omission of uncertainties  or the disregard of  cognitive biases. This session aims to provide practical skills and  reflective insights for handling and visualising data in ways that are  more transparent  equitable and responsible. Session 9: Closing and reflection \u2013 Thursday 20 June 2024 The seventh and final session will be a closing session focused on  reflection. In this session  participants will have the opportunity to  reflect on how the topics covered in the previous sessions apply to  their own professional situations. This session will provide a space for  attendees to share their thoughts  insights  and experiences  and to  discuss how they plan to incorporate the knowledge and skills they have  gained into their work. This will be a valuable opportunity for  participants to consolidate their learning and to develop a personal  plan for applying the principles of Digital Ethics in their professional  lives.

{"text": "Efficient use of a network protocol analyzer in cyber threats  Many companies rely on a Security Information and Event Management system (SIEM) to consolidate data from various applications and equipment  allowing them to maintain an overview of their security landscape. To investigate alerts generated by their SIEM system more thoroughly  they turn to a Network Protocol Analyzer (NPA). An NPA captures  analyzes  and visualizes network traffic and can have a broad range of applications.However  the procedures and configurations of NPAs vary according to the specific issue at hand (cybersecurity  troubleshooting  etc.)  which often leads to incorrect or inefficient usage in practice. During this workshop  we will build the knowledge and skills necessary to use Network Protocol Analyzers correctly and efficiently  particularly in the context of cybersecurity threats. We will work with real-life scenarios and gain practical insights into the underlying workings of NPAs. The NPA that we will delve deeper into during the workshop is the open-source NPA  Wireshark.

{"text": "Structural equation modeling with lavaan    Introduction to the theory and application of structural equation modeling and handling missing data  nonnormal data  categorical data  etc.                               Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a general statistical modeling technique to study the relationships among observed and latent variables. It spans a wide range of multivariate methods including path analysis  mediation analysis  confirmatory factor analysis  growth curve modeling  and many more. Many applications of SEM can be found in the social  economic  behavioral and health sciences  but the technology is increasingly used in disciplines like biology  neuroscience and operation research. SEM is often used to test theories or hypotheses that can be represented by a path diagram. In a path diagram  observed variables are depicted by boxes  while latent variables (hypothetical constructs measured by multiple indicators) are depicted by circles. Hypothesized (possibly causal) effects among these variables are represented by single-headed arrows. If you had ever found yourself drawing a path diagram in order to get a better overview of the complex interrelations among some key variables in your data  this course is for you. The first day of the course provides an introduction to the theory and application of structural equation modeling  and illustrates how to use the open-source R package `lavaan\u2019 (see https://lavaan.org) to conduct an SEM analysis. On the second day  we discuss several special topics that are often needed by applied users (handling missing data  nonnormal data  categorical data  longitudinal data  multilevel data  etc.). With the exception of a short practical session at the end of the first day  the two days are mostly lectures  to maximize the amount of information that we can teach. However  do-it-yourself practicals (with written feedback and solutions) will be made available and illustrate all the topics that are covered in this course. Target audience This course targets everyone with an interest in testing theories or models that involve relationships between both observed and latent variables. The audience for this course can include both novices with little or no previous experience with SEM  as well as existing users who wish to refresh or update their theoretical and practical understanding of structural equation modeling. Fees The participation fee is 750 EUR for participants from the private sector. Reduced prices apply to students and staff from non-profit  social profit  and government organizations. An exam fee of 35 EUR will be applied.

{"text": "A No-Code Approach to Decision Support and Knowledge Capturing  In their day-to-day operations  companies typically make many small but important decisions  such as:  which employee should handle an incoming requestwhich service should be recommended to a specific customerhow should a specific product be configured to meet a customer's requirement whether a specific customer is entitled to a discount  etc.  Decision  support systems can help employees make these decisions faster  more  reliably and more consistently  reducing costs and increasing confidence  in the process. To develop such systems  black-box AI methods (such as  deep learning) are not well-suited  because they lack the required  transparency and explainability. A more promising approach are  knowledge-based AI systems  which derive their 'intelligence' not from  data  but from logical models of rules  regulations and expert  knowledge. In this workshop  you will get to know the  state-of-the-art IDP knowledge-base system  developed at KU Leuven. It  is currently being used by companies in the manufacturing (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpPe0GRjifE)  financial (https://youtu.be/Zzsy4MtdWBE)  and legal sectors to provide various decision support  both to their  customers and in-house. This system is based on methods and techniques  that were developed for declarative programming systems such as Prolog   but it offers a number of important innovations: (1) instead of focusing  only on querying  the IDP system provides a wide range of different  functionalities that can be used to implement rich interactive  interfaces that support users in different work-flows  (2) instead of  relying on programmers  the system allows its end users to maintain the  underlying knowledge base  which means that we can cut out the \"middle  man\" of IT staff and allow the business experts themselves to update the  system  thereby not only reducing cost and turn-around time but also  putting the ownership of the decision knowledge in the right hands. The  workshop starts with a brief introduction to Knowledge-based AI and  presents existing applications in the financial and manufacturing  sectors. We then proceed with a hands-on tutorial  using a freely  available web interface that participants access from their own laptops.  In this workshop, you will get to know the state-of-the-art IDP  knowledge-base system, that has been developed at KU Leuven and is  currently used by companies in various sectors. You will be able to build basic applications using IDP, and you will be able to identify potential use cases for this technology. https://puc.kuleuven.be/nl/opleiding/6kjpeqerb3gbx7zo Workshop workshop-Brugge-KU Leuven Postuniversitair Centrum; VAIA"}

{"text": "Law, Ethics and Policy of Artificial Intelligence  In 2021  KU Leuven organised the first edition of the Summer School  on the Law  Ethics and Policy of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Given the  programme's overwhelming success  three editions have taken place thus  far. The fourth edition will take place from 1 to 10 July 2024. The Summer School aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the  various legal  ethical and policy-related issues around AI and  algorithm-driven processes more broadly. As these technologies have a  growing impact on all domains of our lives  it becomes increasingly  important to map  understand and assess the challenges and opportunities  they raise. This requires an interdisciplinary approach  which is why  we are collaborating across faculties and departments to organise this  Summer School. The programme's goal is to offer participants the latest  insights on AI from various perspectives  and in particular the fields  of law  ethics and policy.  The lectures are provided by renowned academics  policy-makers from  EU and international institutions as well as practitioners  allowing  participants to grasp not only the theoretical but also the practical  implications of the use of AI in these fields.  The Summer School's intended audience concerns postgraduate students  who already obtained a master's degree and junior/senior researchers  from various disciplines  as well as policy analysts  lawyers and legal  experts  civil servants  members of civil society organisations  AI  practitioners  and other professionals with an interest in broadening  their understanding of AI and its impact on society.  Participants receive a certificate of attendance with the equivalence  of 3 ECTS credits. Those interested also have an opportunity to share  their research with fellow participants through a research presentation  session.  Thus far  the Summer School has taken place as a hybrid event  enabling participants to join both on campus and online.  Whether physically or virtually  we look forward to welcoming you to Leuven! Course overview The Summer School covers a range of topics that will enable  participants to better grasp the various legal  ethical and policy  implications of the development and use of AI in society. All lectures  are taught in English. The schedule of the Summer School's 2023 edition can be found here. Most lectures focus on horizontal domains of interest  covering topics such as:  Philosophy of AI Ethics of AI AI and Data Protection Law AI and Competition Law AI and Intellectual Property Law AI and Consumer Protection AI and Liability Law AI and Labour Law AI and Fairnes The European Commission's proposals for an AI Regulation  the Digital Services Act & the Digital Markets Act AI governance and the role of European & International institutions  Though Artificial Intelligence is a general purpose technology  many  of its legal  ethical and policy-related implications are context- or  sector-specific. Therefore  the programme also explores several vertical  domains. These cover inter alia:  AI and Law Enforcement AI and Public Services AI and Warfare AI and Healthcare AI and Education AI and Legal Tech  At the end of the course  participants who attended 90% of the  classes and passed the exam receive a certificate of attendance with an  equivalence of 3 ECTS credits.

{"text": "AI in Business and Industry  The Postgraduate Certificate: Artificial Intelligence in Business and Industry aims  to give engineers  computer scientists and other professionals the  opportunity to specialise in the field of artificial intelligence.  The  programme has been designed with a specific need in the job market in  mind: many current employees in for example R&D divisions of leading  companies are highly skilled but did not receive specific training on  AI in their formal education. Perhaps you  too  experience the need to  bring your AI skills up to date and are looking for a qualitative AI  course to do that. This postgraduate training allows professionals to  acquire in one year a solid academic knowledge of artificial  intelligence  as well as insight into the domains of image and language  (computer vision/NLP) and business aspects of AI.  The postgraduate programme Artificial Intelligence in Business and Industry stands  firmly on its own but also opens the door to more. Participants can  choose to follow a follow-up track into the Advanced Master AI in Business and Industry (to  be launched in September 2023)  where they gain access to the wider  range of in-depth  broadening and  in particular  more applied modules.  The courses offered in the postgraduate programme form an integral part  of the Advanced Master Artificial Intelligence in Business and Industry   and participants who pass the courses in the postgraduate programme  will be granted exemptions when following the rest of the master\u2019s  programme. The programme aims at different  kinds of engineers (e.g. in Engineering Science  Engineering Technology   or Business Engineers who majored in data science or applied computer  science). In addition  the programme is open to masters in mathematics  and physics. In general  any participant with a master\u2019s degree that  offers sufficient background in mathematics  programming and technology  will be admitted. If you do not have one of the aforementioned master  diplomas  you can submit a file with your motivation and CV to the  programme committee  who will assess your application. Note that Python  proficiency (basic) is required. An optional 6-month subscription to  Datacamp can be provided upon registration.  While recently  graduated students are welcome  the programme also offers added value to  professionals with field experience  wishing to re- or upskill  themselves in the field of Artificial Intelligence in order to make the  most of their career opportunities. The programme specifically caters to  participants looking for a theoretical  academically grounded approach  to AI. Given the advanced content of the courses  the profiles most  suitable for this postgraduate are  for example  IT developers and  functional analysts or R&D staff  engineers  project leaders and  managers. The programme starts with the theoretical AI foundations that are indispensable for professionals. Participants therefore get 3 academic courses that teach them the scientific basics of artificial intelligence. In addition  the door is opened to industrial applications and general business applications with the courses in the second semester. Fundamentals of AI In this course  you will acquire a deep knowledge and insight into foundational techniques from Artificial Intelligence  including search methods and their applications to games  the version spaces algorithm for machine learning  constraint processing techniques  strips planning and theorem proving for first-order predicate logic. You will be able to simulate each of the above techniques with pen and paper on small new examples and have insight into the relevance of these techniques for applications in domains such as manufacturing  health  education  logistics  manufacturing  and robotics.  Machine Learning and Inductive Inference This  course will familiarize you with the domain of machine learning  which  concerns techniques to build software that can learn how to perform a  certain task (or improve its performance on it) by studying examples of  how it has been accomplished previously  and in a broader sense the  discovery of knowledge from observations (inductive inference).After following this course  you will have a basic understanding of the general principles of learninghave an overview of the existing techniques for machine learning and data miningunderstand how these techniques work  and why they workbe able to implement programs that learn or exhibit adaptive behavior  using these techniquesbe up-to-date with the current state of the art in machine learning researchbe able to contribute to contemporary machine learning research  Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning The  course aims to introduce the basic techniques  methods and properties  of ANN and to study their application to selected problems. The basic  concepts will be introduced in the lectures. Advanced topics and recent  research results will be touched upon occasionally. You will study and  develop explicit neural network models for selected applications. Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing The  course introduces natural language processing technologies and their  applications in a variety of tasks  which include text mining  machine  translation  question answering and dialogue modelling. It also  introduces computer vision algorithms and their applications such as  image classification  object detection  and image segmentation. Special  attention goes to applications that require the joint processing of  language and visual data  as this is a natural way to interact with  machines.  The students will gain insights into suitable machine  learning algorithms that ideally are trained with limited annotated  examples or human feedback. They will learn how to build and critically  assess an application making use of the most recent techniques and  resources.  Business Analytics In this course  you will  learn to understand how business problems can be formulated with  advanced analytics techniques as a potential solution.

{"text": "Cyberattack response  In this session  we provide a comprehensive guide on  effectively responding to cyber-attacks within the bounds of the law.  The presentation explores the intricate web of legal considerations that  accompany cyber incidents  delving into the realms of criminal law   data protection  privacy laws  and regulatory compliance together with  all other possible side effects.  We begin by dissecting the  anatomy of a cyber-attack through an incident response plan. A  significant portion of the lecture is dedicated to the legal framework  surrounding cyber-attacks. This includes an examination of data breach  notification requirements  both domestically and internationally  as  well as an exploration of the evolving landscape of cyber-related  legislation. The discussion extends to the legal obligations imposed on  organisations  shedding light on potential liabilities and consequences  for non-compliance.  Furthermore  the lecture addresses  upon  experiences learned  the critical role of digital forensics in incident  response and legal proceedings. We gain an understanding of best  practices for preserving electronic evidence  ensuring its admissibility  in court  and collaborating with law enforcement agencies. The lecture  also focuses on the post-incident phase  elucidating the legal aspects  of breach disclosure  communication strategies  and managing  reputational fallout. Practical guidance on engaging with regulatory  bodies  law enforcement  and legal counsel is provided  offering a  roadmap for a coordinated and lawful response to cyber incidents.  To  conclude  we get a firsthand account from a company (TVH) that has  experienced a cyberattack and that has been through the challenges of  post-attack damage control.

{"text": "Applied Artificial Intelligence  You already have a degree and/or you are an innovative entrepreneur or ambitious business developer. You're passionate about technology and want to be a part of a quickly evolving world of AI You're creative and a problem solver. You enjoy analysing problems and finding systematic solutions. You know the basics of programming. No experience with programming? We recommend finishing a one-year programming course first. Afterwards you can enrol for this postgraduate degree.  You are expected to master the basics of programming  so what does this entail? The postgraduate course is a very hands-on course. During the  different workshops  you will usually use a computer and get to work  with Python. You can find a lot of tutorials online about Python and  programming. Main concepts you need to master are: variables  basic  arithmic functions  string manipulations  looping and conditionals. An extensive knowledge of Python is required as we use extended standard libraries during the classes. Is attendance required for each class? There is no obligation. But the strength of the program is the  personal interaction with teachers and students. All classes are also  professionally streamed and recorded if you cannot attend every class  live. There are also group works  so your attendance is recommended for  those projects. When do the classes take place? Classes always take place on Tuesdays between 9 am and 6 pm at the latest  which allows for combination with work.  What language is the course taught in? All courses are taught entirely in English. However  most teachers can also answer your questions in Dutch. We provide you with the necessary tools  techniques and insights to become an all-round player in the field of artificial intelligence. The first semester will be all about the foundations of artificial intelligence with deep insights into data science  machine learning and big data. The second semester will have a focus on practicality  where intelligent interfaces  NLP platforms  speech platforms  computer vision and robotics will be at the centre of our programme. Finally  you also get the opportunity to gain experience in the field during an internship at an AI company. AI fundamentals  During the introductory week you will be immersed in various aspects  of AI: how does AI learn  which techniques and applications are there   and what are the pitfalls and limits that you have to take into account?  Data Science  You become acquainted with the entire work chain of the data  scientist  from collecting and processing the data over modelling the  problem to deliver the result to the customer. We always emphasize the  pitfalls and the boundaries of AI and we ensure that our results are  ethically responsible and safe.  Machine Learning  We dig deeper into the core of AI: machine learning. We deal with  regression and classification  investigate the functioning of neural  networks  deep learning  genetic algorithms  clustering  etc. We learn  to train models using existing libraries  considering the limitations of  the data set that we are starting from. IoT & Big Data IoT is getting more and more important in our daily lives. Smart  cities  industry 4.0  e-health  the applications are countless. Through  this evolution  loads of data are being created that all have to find  their way to the Cloud where they are processed into information that is  of interest to the user. In this course we learn techniques to process  and visualize large amounts of data in an efficient way. We are also  introduced to the newest trend of edge computing that places less  pressure on the Cloud.  AI Project  In this course  you will be immersed in state-of-the-art AI  technologies to prepare you to develop your own project independently or  as part of a team  under the guidance of our own AI experts. Previous  student projects include: - Smart Home with an AI model to manage your electricity use - AI Platform that teaches you sign-language - Drones that follow you based on facial recognition - And many more...  Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) In the professional and academical world a lot of models are created  but only a few make it to deployment and/or production environment. The  reason for this is that most AI-experts still manually organise their  worksflows. Machine Learning Operation (MLOps) should bring an end to  this. In this course we talk about the challenges within MLOps  the  workflows and we will use industry standard MLOps tools. Internship (Optional)  The internship offers students a unique opportunity to gain several weeks of hands-on experience at leading companies such as ML6  Imec and Human.ai. Students work on real AI projects  learn from experts and expand their professional network. This hands-on experience allows students to apply their acquired knowledge  gain insight into the day-to-day practice of AI and prepare for a successful career while making valuable connections with potential employers in the industry. After completing our postgraduate degree in Artificial Intelligence  students will have the crucial knowledge and skills to be successful in the AI domain. They will be able to apply machine learning and deep learning techniques  develop effective solutions to complex problems and integrate ethical considerations into AI applications.

{"text": "Enabling the future of work  This course will be given by Prof. Rob Heyman on Friday 22 March 2024 from 9.30 to 16:30 CET at the FARI Test & Experience Center (Cantersteen 16  1000  Brussels). The problems or challenges we wish to address in this 1-day course are: Adopt AI or die: there is a push to use a form of artificial  intelligence for each organization  and failure to do so seems to imply  the end of your organization\u2019s history. But how do you ensure that your  investments in AI are sustainable and successfully adopted by your  colleagues and employees? While you are adapting to this new technological context  you will also have to deal with new regulations. How will you do this? Lastly  adopting technological and legal change is not something you  do on your own  so what are methods to facilitate this change in your  organization? While not absolutely necessary  it helps to have a clear challenge in  mind when joining this session. Rob will invite you to work on your  innovation case or with someone in case you lack one. Knowledge of legal frameworks or AI is not necessary. Session 1: How to and how not to Introduce Automation on the Work Floor We will look at practical  theoretical concepts to understand  innovation on the work floor and the tension between users and  technology. The aim is to understand all successful technology  adoptions as innovations that change users\u2019 daily practices. Next  we discuss cases where AI or industry 4.0 applications were  introduced and what these meant for different stakeholders. If you have a  case  you wish to discuss  be sure to contact Rob Heyman to discuss  this as part of the session. Session 2: Boosting Operational Efficiency by Reducing Digital Friction and Increasing Agility If you believe innovation can only be successful if practices change  then it follows that regulations can only be successful if regulations change practices  too. In this part we look at the particular challenges we experienced during the implementation of the GDPR and what this might mean for the implementation of the AI Act. Session 3: Improving Information Protection and Governance During the last part of the day  we will use a case for innovation of your choosing and define a workshop or process to include colleagues and employees in this process. In this interactive part  you will learn a few facilitation methods and the key ingredients to define co-creation projects on your work floor. This training was designed for decision  makers from public organizations that want to fully empower workforces  with flexible digital workplaces  increased agility and stronger  information protection to address current business needs and evolving  challenges.

{"text": "A new symbolic-numeric method to solve the multiparameter eigenvalue problem  In this talk  we focus on polynomial systems coming from the multiparameter eigenvalue problem and certain generalizations. Using the theory of resultants and Weyman complexes  we present new matrices of optimal size for solving these systems. This talk is based on joint work with Jean Charles Faug\u00e8re  Angelos Mantzaflaris  and Elias Tsigaridas.  A classical approach to solving polynomial systems is to linearize the problem and reduce it to an eigenvalue calculation. For this purpose, certain families of special matrices are used, e.g., Sylvester and Dixon matrices. Their size and structure determine how far these methods can go; therefore, it is essential to construct better matrices for the specific systems that arise in practice.  https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~sistawww/bdm/backtotheroots/index.php/seminars Seminar by Mat\u00edas R.

{"text": "Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Psychiatric Medicine: Trustworthiness, Epistemic Justice, and Empowerment  Medicine has a distinct set of moral responsibilities. This is because the physician-patient relationship contains inherent inequalities of knowledge  skills  and control of resources  and it treats matters both intimate and potentially of great importance to the patient (Rhodes 2001; Nickel & Frank 2020). These responsibilities include physician\u2019s obligation to earn trust and be trustworthy (Rhodes 2001; 2020). The field of psychiatric medicine faces additional ethical challenges specifically related to patient trust.

Inaugural lecture of the Kulak Francqui Chair 2024 by Prof. Dr. Marco Zorzi Deep learning in artificial neural networks is the driving force behind the contemporary revolution brought by AI technologies. Deep neural networks  show impressive performance in a wide range of domains  from image  processing to natural language understanding. What insights can we  derive from these \u201cartificial brains\u201d about the human mind and brain?  Conversely  can we use behavioural and neuroscientific methods to test and challenge these AI systems? In this talk  Professor Marco Zorzi will discuss interdisciplinary research that emphasizes a constant dialogue between cognitive (neuro)science and AI. Contrasting  humans and machines in terms of learning and performance  including  failures  is the key to deepen our understanding of human cognition and  to highlight necessary improvements in AI technologies. 18.30 | Welcome 19:00 | Opening of the ceremony  Welcome by Professor Piet Desmet  vice rector KU Leuven Kulak Introduction by Professor Bert Reynvoet  promotor  Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences KU Leuven Kulak 19:15 | Inaugural lecture by Professor Marco Zorzi  Minds and Machines: A Dialogue Between Cognitive Science and AI 20:25 | Closing remarks by Professor Fien Depaepe  Dean of the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences KU Leuven Kulak 20:30 | Reception The inaugural lecture will be preceded and followed by a series of lectures at KU Leuven Kulak and Leuven by Prof. Marco Zorzi.

{"text": "Explaining and Predicting Outcomes with Linear Regression    Explaining and Predicting Outcomes with Linear Regression                               Linear regression addresses how a continuous dependent variable is associated by one or more predictors of any type. The fact that many practical problems deal with continuous outcomes (e.g. income  blood pressure  temperature  affect) makes linear regression a popular tool  and most of us will be familiar with the concept of drawing a line through a cloud of data points. The first two sessions of this module introduce the conceptual framework of this method using the simple case of a single predictor. Formulas and technicalities are kept to a minimum and the main focus is on interpretation of results and assessing model validity. This includes confidence statements on the predictor effect (hypothesis tests and confidence intervals)  using the regression model to predict future results and verification of model assumptions. In session 3 and 4 we allow for more than one predictor leading to the multiple linear regression model. We focus on either explanation or prediction. How to come to a parsimonious model starting from a large number of predictors will be discussed in detail. In these complex linear models special attention will be given to interpreting individual predictor effects  as they critically depend on other terms in the model and underlying relations between predictors (confounding). In the last session a more elaborate data analysis is discussed. We touch on problems where linear regression is not appropriate and replaced by related approaches such as generalized linear models and mixed models. Different features will be illustrated with case examples from the instructors practical experience  and participants are encouraged to bring examples from their own work. Hands-on exercises are worked out behind the PC using the R software. Target audience This course targets professionals and investigators from all areas who are involved in prediction problems or need to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more explanatory variables. Fees The participation fee is 1100 EUR for participants from the private sector. Reduced prices apply to students and staff from non-profit  social profit  and government organizations.

{"text": "KG3D Learning and Reasoning Webinar  by Simon Vandevelde Operational decisions are an important part of knowledge-intensive organizations  as these are taken in a high volume on a daily basis. However  describing these decisions in a standardized format such as DMN is a time-consuming task  as various textual sources need to be analyzed. In this talk  we present the results of our experiments on an automated approach to generating decision tables from natural language based on the GPT-3 LLM. Through a total of 72 experiments over six problem descriptions  we evaluated GPT-3\u2019s decision logic modeling and reasoning capabilities. While GPT-3 demonstrates promising abilities in extracting decision context and identifying relevant variables from natural language  further enhancements are needed to improve its decision table capabilities for efficient automation of DMN modeling. by Ioannis Dasoulas An abundance of tabular data exists and is used by a wide range of applications. However  a big portion of these data lack the semantic information necessary for users and machines to properly understand them. This lack of table semantic understanding impedes their usage in data analytics pipelines. Existing solutions are focused on specific annotation tasks and types of tables  and rely solely on large knowledge bases  making it difficult to re-use in real-world settings. In this talk  we present TorchicTab  aversatile semantic table interpretation system able to annotate tables with varied structures by using either an external knowledge graph  such as Wikidata  or annotated tables with pre-defined terms for training. The results demonstrate TorchicTab\u2019s ability to produce accurate annotations for different tasks across varied datasets.

The focus is on the computational features of the Moment-SOS hierarchy  its limitations and current efforts to overcome them.  Polynomial optimization consists of minimizing a polynomial of many real variables subject to polynomial equality and inequality constraints. Its special case is the problem of finding real solutions of a system of polynomial equations. This difficult problem has many applications in fields such as statistics, signal processing, machine learning, computer vision, computational geometry, and control engineering. The Moment-SOS hierarchy is an approach to polynomial optimization that solves it globally at the price of solving a family of convex (semidefinite) optimization problems of increasing size. https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~sistawww/bdm/backtotheroots/index.php/seminars Seminar by Didier Henrion, LAAS-CNRS, Toulouse, France seminar-Heverlee; Leuven-KU Leuven ESAT STADIUS"}

It is from the moment that that initial dataset needs to be shared with more than one application and needs to be combined with other datasets managed by other organizations on different machines, that more complex computer science and information technology problems arise. In this course we will deep-dive in the current state of the art in creating Knowledge on WebScale. Your personal data, data published publicly on the Web and data explicitly shared with you, becomes your Knowledge Graph that applications and services can use to assist you in your day to day activities.

Multivariate statistical methods may be used  but for often the dimensionality of the data set is much larger than the number of (biological) samples. Modern advances in statistical data analyses allow for the appropriate analysis of such data. Methods for the analysis of high dimensional data rely heavily on multivariate statistical methods. Therefore a large part of the course content is devoted to multivariate methods  but with a focus on high dimensional settings and issues. Multivariate statistical analysis covers many methods. In this course a selection of techniques is covered based on our experience that they are frequently used in industry and research institutes.

{"text": "Fast and Stable Roots of Polynomials via Companion Matrices  To compactly store the matrix we will show that only 3n-1 rotators are required  so the storage space is O(n). In fact  these rotators only represent the unitary part  but we will show that we can retrieve the rank-one part from the unitary part with a trick. It is thus not necessary to store the rank-one part explicitly. Francis\u2019s algorithm tuned for working on this representation requires only O(n) flops per iteration and thus O(n\u00b2) flops in total. The algorithm is normwise backward stable and is shown to be about as accurate as the (slow) Francis QR algorithm applied to the companion matrix without exploiting the structure. It is also faster than other O(n\u00b2) methods that have been proposed  and its accuracy is comparable or better. The paper accompanying this research received SIAM\u2019s outstanding paper prize in 2017.https://www.siam.org/prizes-recognition/major-prizes-lectures/detail/siam-outstanding-paper-prizes  Raf Vandebril presents a fast and stable algorithm for computing roots of polynomials. The roots are found by computing the eigenvalues of the associated companion matrix. A companion matrix is an upper Hessenberg matrix that is of unitary-plus-rank-one form, that is, it is the sum of a unitary matrix and a rank-one matrix. When running Francis\u2019s implicitly-shifted QR algorithm this property is preserved, and exactly that is exploited here. https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~sistawww/bdm/backtotheroots/index.php/seminars Seminar by Raf Vandebril seminar-Heverlee; Leuven-KU Leuven ESAT STADIUS"}

Data analysis in sports is definitely changing the game.  Data analysis helps sports entities evaluate the performance of their  athletes and assess the recruitment necessary to improve the team's  performance. It also evaluates the strong and weak areas of their  opponents, enabling coaches to make the right decision on their tactics.  But data is not only used in performance optimization. It is also used in the storytelling of the game and the safety monitoring of the athlete/venue.  The Becoming An Olympian In Sports Analytics (BOSA) Winter School, organized by the IDLab Sports Data Science teams of Ghent University and the University of Antwerp, focuses on each of these topics. It is a week-long intensive course bringing together junior and senior academics and practitioners in the field of sports data science. Two tracks will be organized in parallel  with sufficient cross-pollination: (i) a track focused on sports  scientists that want to gather more AI/data science skills, and (ii) a  more hands-on track for computer scientists to apply their  expertise/skills in a sports context.

{"text": "Exploiting Sources of Variation in your Data: the ANOVA Approach    In this course we will focus on correct execution of data analysis and understanding its results. We pay attention to expressing these conclusions in a correct and understandable way.                               To emphasize the practical approach in this course all classes will take place in a pc room. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a statistical tool used in the comparison of means of a random variable over populations that differ in one or more characteristics (factors)  e.g. treatment  age  sex  subject  etc. First  we cover one-way ANOVA  where only one factor is of concern. Depending on the type of the factor  the conclusions pertain to just those factor levels included in the study (fixed factor model)  or to a population of factor levels of which we observed a sample (random effects model). In two-way and multi-way ANOVA where populations differ in more than one characteristic  the effects of factors are studied simultaneously. This yields information about the main effects of each of the factors as well as about any special joint effects (factorial design). We also consider nested designs  where each level of a second (mostly random) factor occurs in conjunction with only one level of the first factor. One special challenge in multi-way ANOVA lies in verifying the assumptions that must be satisfied. In this course we will focus on correct execution of data analysis and understanding its results. We pay attention to expressing these conclusions in a correct and understandable way. The different methods will be extensively illustrated with examples from scientific studies in a variety of fields. Exercises are worked out behind PC using the R software. Target audience This course targets professionals and investigators from diverse areas  who need to use statistical methods in the collection and handling of data in their research  in particular for assessing the effect of e.g. different treatments.

Over the past decade  concerns about the societal risks posed by AI systems have been steadily growing. AI systems have already been known to reinforce discriminatory biases  violate privacy  and manipulate public discourse. A wealth of technical work has been produced to assess and mitigate those risks  yet it is often based on simplistic assumptions of the role that AI plays in the real world.  The goal of this symposium is to tighten the link between technical viewpoints on the societal risks of AI and those from industry  law and policy. Hence  top experts in Belgium representing these diverse viewpoints  from within academia and without  will present their work and the challenges they face in addressing the societal risks of AI. Afterwards  they will participate in a panel discussion.

{"text": "Mixed feedback systems  Event-based technology is developing at a fast pace (e.g. via  neuromorphic computing and event-based cameras) but we currently lack a  control theory of event-based systems. The general aim is to conceive  physical machines that combine the reliability of discrete automata and  the robustness and adaptation of physical control systems. The theory of mixed feedback systems aims at leveraging the existing  theory of control  optimization  and learning while acknowledging the  inherent out-of-equilibrium nature of event-based machines. The theory is grounded in the operator-theoretic framework of maximal  monotonicity in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces. The course will  introduce those mathematical tools at a basic level and present how they  can be used to analyze and design neuromorphic event-based machines. The course consists of six sessions over three days. Each session will cover one of the following modules Module1: Feedback and memory (RS) 1.1. Examples of mixed feedback systems. Motivation. Current  limitations of control theory  machine learning  and neuromorphic  engineering. 1.2. Static mixed feedback 1.3. Dynamic mixed feedback. Questions and challenges Module 2: Feedback system analysis (TC) 2.1. Systems as operators. Phase and Gain. Monotonicity and Lipschitz operators. The passivity and the small-gain theorems. 2.2.

Within the safety & security domain  it is a  challenge to inform individuals and organizations working together  around a common problem in such a way that activities can be developed. This means that sufficient information must be present to coordinate  activities  while access to information must be possible within the  network. Without these two conditions  it is impossible to address a  security threat or coordinate a crisis.  Those challenges create several issues regarding the coordination of  information  the integration of technology within and between  organizations and networks  the use of Generative Artificial  Intelligence to achieve better decision-making  etc. In this lecture   Mr. Chaara elaborates on these issues and tries to answer the challenges  posed.

{"text": "Drawing Conclusions from Data: an Introduction    This course aims to provide insight into basic statistical concepts with emphasis on practical applications.                               Description This course aims to provide insight into basic statistical concepts with emphasis on practical applications. Mathematical formulae will be kept to a minimum. The theory and the methods of analysis will be extensively illustrated with examples relating to a wide variety of different fields. To emphasize the practical approach in this course all classes will take place in a pc room. The practical part of the first session (after the break) will be dedicated to getting to know the software package R. Participants are encouraged to participate in both parts. We start with concise graphical and numerical descriptions of data obtained from observational or experimental studies. The most common and frequently used probability distributions of discrete and continuous variables will be presented. Statistical inference draws conclusions about a population based on sampled data. Chance variations are taken into account such that a level of confidence is attached to these conclusions. We present the reasoning behind significance tests for the comparison of observed data with a hypothesis  the validity of which we want to assess. We apply this procedure to data obtained either from one or from two populations. The correct use of the t-test will be discussed. Nonparametric methods are considered as a possible alternative in case the requirements of the t-test are not met. We cover the basic concepts of hypothesis testing for categorical data  including the chi-square test. Quite often the relationship between two variables  where the outcome of one variable is seen as depending on the value of the other  is the focus of scientific interest. We will give an introduction to linear regression analysis  where a regression line based on observations obtained in a sample describes this relation. Hands-on exercises are worked out behind the PC using the R software. Target audience This course will benefit professionals and investigators from diverse areas  research scientists  clinical research associates  investing in data handling and wishing to acquire insight into basic statistical methods or to refresh their knowledge and practice of statistics.

{"text": "Ethical Perceptions of AI: How Does it Matter for Hiring?  Abstract of the lecture  The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) entails enormous ethical challenges. Especially  we do not fully understand how ethical perceptions about AI influence both job applicants and the organizations that use AI for hiring purposes. In this session  we will discuss important aspects of using AI in hiring processes. First  we will discuss that AI is not created equally in terms of ethical perceptions. Indeed  people view the use of AI differently depending on what aspects of the hiring process it is used for (e.g.  analyzing CV vs. analyzing one\u2019s social media). Then  we will discuss the influence of ethical perceptions of AI in hiring on the trust individuals put in organizations that use AI in hiring. We will focus on the importance individuals lend to AI performing its expected role  and how this expectation influences their ethical perceptions of AI  and in turn the trust they put on organizations using AI in hiring. Finally  we will further discuss whether and how ethical perceptions of using AI in hiring are related to individuals\u2019 attraction to organizations that use AI in hiring. Circling back to the beginning of the session  we will discuss that the influence of ethical perceptions of using AI in hiring are not consistent across hiring methods. For example  only individuals who consider it ethical for organizations to use AI in intrusive ways  such as analyzing social media information for traits and characteristics  viewed such organizations as more attractive.

{"text": "Getting started with R software for data analysis    This course introduces the use of the R environment for the implementation of data management  data exploration  basic statistical analysis and automation of procedures.                               Description R is a flexible environment for statistical computing and graphics  which is becoming increasingly popular as a tool to get insight in often complex data. While in some ways similar to other programming languages (such as C  Java and Perl)  R is particularly suited for data analysis because ready-made functions are available for a wide variety of statistical (classical statistical tests  linear and nonlinear modeling  timeseries analysis  classification  clustering  ...) and graphical techniques. The base R program can be extended with user-submitted packages  which means new techniques are often implemented in R before being available in other software. This is one of the reasons why R is becoming the de facto standard in certain fields such as bioinformatics (Bioconductor) and financial services. This course introduces the use of the R environment for the implementation of data management  data exploration  basic statistical analysis and automation of procedures. It starts with a description of the R GUI  the use of the command line and an overview of basic data structures. The application of standard procedures to import data or to export results to external files will be illustrated. Creation of new variables  subsetting  merging and stacking of data sets will be covered in the data management section. Exploration of the data by histograms  box plots  scatter plots  summary numbers  correlation coefficients and cross-tabulations will be performed. Simple statistical procedures that will be covered are: comparisons of observed group means (t-test  ANOVA and their non-parametric versions) and proportionstest for independence in 2-way cross tables and linear regression (focusing on the R-implementation of the statistical methods that are the subject of other modules of the statistics series)Finally  installing new packages and automation of analysis procedures will also be discussed. Practical sessions and specific exercises will be provided to allow participants to practice their R skills in interaction with the teacher. Target audience This course targets professionals and investigators from diverse areas with little to no R-programming experience who wish to start using R for their data manipulation  data exploration or statistical analysis.

{"text": "Ethical Issues of Generative AI  The social and economic impact of generative AI systems is likely to be major in many potential uses  for example in the environment or in healthcare. However  these generative AI systems raise many ethical  epistemological  anthropological  psychological  economic  social  political and cultural questions. Some of these issues will continue to occur as these technologies are put to new uses  and it is not yet possible to predict all the effects they will have on individuals and society. Since the end of 2022  economic and political actors in several countries are discussing the impact of language models built with these generative AI systems. Some of these models have an impressive number of parameters. The race for the largest model is ongoing  but it is not certain that larger models would deliver higher performance. Laurence Devillers was involved as a co-writer of the opinion n\u00b07 of the ethical issues of generative artificial intelligence in the CNPEN (National Pilot Committee for Digital Ethics). In this opinion  CNPEN focuses on the most important ethical issues in the light of current experience with generative AI systems  mainly on language models.

{"text": "Lost in Meaning - Found in Translation  The FoTran project is interested in the ability of neural translation models to pick up linguistic properties and to generalise to meaningful representations when trained on large amounts of multilingual data. Their focus is on the effect of linguistic diversity on abstraction and generalisation. In order to study this  they need to create the necessary resources and infrastructure. In this talk  J\u00f6rg Tiedemann will first introduce the OPUS ecosystem that fuels his research. In the second part  he will concentrate on the experiments  studies and developments that this ecosystem enables within and outside of FoTran. He welcomes discussions on further directions that can be taken with the multilingual infrastructure the FoTran project builds.

{"text": "Bohemian Matrices: An introduction and some open problems  The name \u201cBohemian matrices\u201d was proposed for a field that has actually been studied for many years now by different researchers  not recognizing their commonality. The name comes from an acronym for BOunded HEight Matrices  of Integers  although the restriction to integers has been subsequently relaxed. The \u201cheight\u201d of a vector is its infinity norm  and the \u201cheight\u201d of a matrix A is the infinity norm of vec(A). The word \u201cheight\u201d has been commonly used in the context of univariate polynomials expressed in the monomial basis: the height of a polynomial is the infinity norm of the vector of coefficients. We say \u201ccharacteristic height\u201d for the height of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix A. The idea is to restrict the study to families of matrices all of whose entries come from a finite (and hence bounded) set  called the population. Well-known examples include zero-one or binary matrices  Bernoulli matrices whose entries are either 1 or -1  and sign pattern matrices where the entries can be 1  0  or -1. One can then study Bohemian families of structured matrices  say upper Hessenberg Toeplitz Bohemian matrices  or complex symmetric tridiagonal Bohemian matrices  or symmetric matrices with entries from a restricted population  or Bohemian companion matrices  or other families. In this talk I will survey some known results  and discuss some problems that remain open. In particular  I will ask for help in finding algorithms to construct \u201cminimal height\u201d companion matrices for polynomials with integer coefficients; such things exist (possibly not uniquely) but there is no known good algorithm for constructing them. I will give examples where the height of the companion matrix is exponentially smaller (in the degree/dimension) than is the characteristic height. This seems interesting because lower height offers the hope of better eigenvalue conditioning. But even that is not well-understood. This is joint work with many people.

{"text": "Numerical linear algebra for multivariate polynomial solving  Utilizing optimization algorithms  one seeks to identify the best model in a chosen model class. This methodology finds widespread application across thousands of use cases within the AI community. However  there is no guarantee that optimization algorithms will find the best model. Present-day optimization practices are heuristic in nature  yielding results that may not be reproducible and consequently difficult to interpret. The main objective of the Back to the Roots project is to develop a theoretical framework that combines model classes and optimization algorithms  enabling the calculation of the optimal model within the specified model class with 100% certainty. This seminar series brings international experts to Leuven in 2023-2024. The seminar series is centered around the key themes of the Back to the Roots project: globally optimal system identification  polynomial optimization  multiparameter eigenvalue problems  system theory for multidimensional systems.  The ERC research project \"Back to the roots of data-driven dynamical system identification\", led by Prof. Dr. Bart De Moor (KU Leuven, ESAT-STADIUS), focuses on system identification, where mathematical models are derived from observed data generated by systems such as medical monitoring, electricity consumption and industrial processes. https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~sistawww/bdm/backtotheroots/index.php/seminars Numerical linear algebra for multivariate polynomial solving Seminariereeks-Leuven-KU Leuven ESAT STADIUS"}

Authors of accepted abstracts will have the opportunity to submit a full paper after the conference to CLIN Journal. CLIN33 organizes a shared task on the Automatic Detection of AI-Generated Texts. With the surge of powerful automatic content generation comes the important task of distinguishing texts generated by language models from texts written by humans. Therefore  the CLIN33 shared task invites you to contribute to the development of automatic detection systems of AI-generated texts. The shared task consists of two tracks.  Visit the shared task website for more information Detection Track In this track you will develop a system that detects whether a document is generated by a language model or written by a human. The system will be evaluated on a test dataset that will remain hidden. For tuning your system you will be provided with a sample of the test data as a development set. Your system will be submitted as a notebook (colab or jupyter) and be self-containedThe test data will not be sharedYou will be provided with a subset of the test data for validation and developmentNo training data will be provided  you are expected to create your own when using Machine LearningThere will be a scoreboard for testing your model on the validation data that you can use to monitor progress during developmentThere will be three genres of text: newspaper text  tweets  and poemsThe text will be generated by different language models (we will provide information about which models later)The generated text will be produced using different prompt engineering strategies (standard  academic level  middle school level  human-like  ...)There will be an English and a Dutch subtrack. Participants are expected to participate in both. There will be a prize for the team that develops the best performing system averaged over both languages and all conditions. Explanation Track (optional) In this track  you will provide a qualitative analysis  empirically supported by the output of your system on the validation set  of the knowledge used by your model to solve the task. This explanation can be in terms of statistical properties or in terms of linguistic patterns and phenomena and will the form of a short paper (4 pages max).

{"text": "Local &amp; Sustainable AI, Data, and Robotics  The world becomes more urbanized. Over 56% of the world population now lives in cities  and this number can go as high as 97% in Belgium. In parallel  technology plays an increasingly important role in these environments. Specifically: Artificial intelligence  Data  and Robotics have become an integral part of living in cities. We may not always be aware of their presence  but they are playing a critical role in our daily commutes  government services  local stores  or in the public space. Concepts such as \"smart cities\" have emerged and reflect the continuing desire of cities to implement these technologies on a large scale to address local challenges - one of which is  of course  becoming even more sustainable. AI and data are now being actively used in a variety of areas  from energy sharing to biodiversity monitoring. Despite these hopes  growing concerns have emerged about the overall inhibiting impact of these technologies on sustainability. In addition  ethical and legal concerns have emerged  to the point where cities enact local responsible use principles  also insisting on greater citizen inclusion. This conference will investigate if and how AI  Data  and Robotics  can become local and are truly sustainable for cities.

{"text": "Review of DNN optimization and compression methods for Edge AI systems  During the last years  Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have gained a great importance in several research domains and applications that can learn from data. Thus  one can use DNN for image processing  actions recognition  text classification  language processing  speech recognition  etc. However  this high success of DNN models is accompanied by a high increase of computation time  architecture complexity  and memory storage. Moreover  the deployment and exploitation of DNN models in real environments is generally related to connected sensors (cameras  microphones  temperature sensors  etc.) where the inference process needs to be executed in real time on embedded or edge resources. In this work  we present an overview of the three main compression methods (pruning  quantization  knowledge distillation) that allow to reduce the computation time and memory size of DNN models while keeping a high accuracy. Experimental results are conducted within image classification  object detection and actions recognition with DNN models that were optimized and deployed on Edge AI resources such as Jetson Nano  Jetson Xavier and Jetson Orin. The obtained results showed that we could reach a compression factor of around 6x while keeping a good accuracy  and we also observe a speedup of 3x compared to non-compressed models.

{"text": "Optimisation in Machine Learning  13:00 - 13:40 Optimization of macro-at-k metrics in multi-label classification(Prof. dr. Krzysztof Dembczy\u0144ski \u2014 Yahoo! Research  USA aned Pozna\u0144 University of Technology  Poland) We consider a problem of optimizing macro-averaged complex performance metrics in multi-label classification  that is metrics linearly decomposable into a sum of binary classification utilities applied separately to each label. We focus on tasks in which the algorithm is required to predict exactly k labels for each instance  leading to macro-at-k metrics. The constraint couples the otherwise independent binary classification tasks  leading to a much more challenging optimization problem than standard macro-averages. We analyze the problem in two different statistical regimes  namely in the expected test utility (ETU) and the population utility (PU) frameworks. The former aims at optimizing the expected performance on a given test set  while the latter optimizes the performance on a population level. For both frameworks we derive optimal prediction rules and practical algorithmic solutions with provable statistical guarantees. Empirical results provide evidence for the competitive performance of the proposed approaches.   13:40 - 14:20 On extensions of loss minimisation for training uncertainty-aware predictors (Prof. dr. Eyke H\u00fcllermeier \u2014 LMU Munich  Germany) Due to the steadily increasing relevance of machine learning for practical applications  many of which are coming with safety requirements  the notion of uncertainty has received increasing attention in machine learning research in the recent past. This talk will address questions and challenges regarding the representation and adequate handling of (predictive) uncertainty in (supervised) machine learning. A specific focus will be put on the distinction between two important types of uncertainty  often referred to as aleatoric and epistemic. In this regard  a recent generalisation of the common (empirical) loss minimisation approach in machine learning will be critically anaysed and shown to be fundamentally flawed.   14:20 - 15:00 Learning from user and environment in combinatorial optimisation (Prof. dr. ir. Tias Guns \u2014 KU Leuven  Belgium) Industry and society are increasingly automating processes  which requires solving combinatorial optimisation problems. To find not just optimal solutions  but also 'desirable' solutions for the end user  it is increasingly important to offer AI tools that automatically learn from the user and the environment and that support the constraint modelling in interpretable ways. In this talk I will provide an overview of three different ways in which AI can augment the modeling part of combinatorial optimisation. This includes learning from the user (preference learning in VRP)  learning from the environment (end-to-end decision focussed learning) and explanation generation  that sit at the intersection of learning and reasoning. As part of this work  we are building a modern constraint programming language called CPMpy(http://cpmpy.readthedocs.io) that eases integration of multiple constraint solving paradigms with machine learning and other scientific python libraries. I will shortly highlight its possibilities beyond the above cases  as well as our larger vision of conversational human-aware technology for optimisation.   16:00 - 18:00 Efficient algorithms for set-valued prediction in classification (Public PhD defence ir. Thomas Mortier \u2014 Ghent University)  In recent years  the use of machine learning has gained popularity in solving complex tasks across multiple domains  including robotics  healthcare  biology and finance. However  with the increasing amount of data and complexity of tasks  the notion of uncertainty has become of major importance in machine learning. The ability to represent uncertainty in an efficient and trustworthy way should therefore be considered as a key feature of any machine learning method. This thesis aims to address this challenge by focusing on the development of principled tools to efficiently represent uncertainty in machine learning. In particular  the concept of set-valued prediction is highlighted  which provides end-users with multiple answers instead of a single answer with little guarantee. To this end  probabilistic classification is considered  where the unknown relationship between inputs and classes is assumed to be non-deterministic and expressed by a conditional class distribution. A distinction between several settings in classification is made and different biological applications are considered  including large-scale bacterial species identification using Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) data.  The goal of this small-scale mini-symposium is to bring together researchers interested in the topic of optimisation in machine learning. It is meant to provide a place for the discussion of the most recent developments in optimisation in machine learning problems, and the exploration of new research directions in this field. https://sites.google.com/view/oml23/homepage Mini-Symposium Mini-symposium-Ghent-UGent"}

{"text": "Interpretable deep learning for cancer personalized medicine  In recent years  deep learning models have resulted in outstanding breakthrough performances. However  many models behave as black boxes that can hide data biases  incorrect hypotheses or even software errors. In this talk  Maria Rodriguez Martinez (IBM Z\u00fcrich) illustrates how interpretable deep learning models can achieve both high prediction accuracy and transparency. First  she will introduce multi-modal deep learning models that predict drug response while highlighting the genetic and chemical patterns that were more informative to make a prediction. Rodriguez Martinez also discusses how reinforcement learning approaches can facilitate the early phases of drug discovery and support the personalized design of new candidate compounds. Focusing next on T cell-based immunotherapies  she presents a model to predict the binding of T cell receptors and epitopes. This model can be coupled with an easy-to-use interpretable pipeline to extract the binding rules governing the T cell binding. These approaches are a first step towards the design and engineering of receptors of improved affinity. Finally  she will briefly discuss how interpretable models enable the linkage of different data modalities  such as image and molecular data. In doing so  they can pave the way to the development of personalized models of therapeutic interventions.

{"text": "Triple helix for control: model-based, learning and embodied intelligence  Often robotics and artificial intelligence are seen as the same. But many robots do not use artificial intelligence algorithms for the control of their behaviour. Their control is dependent on known models  and  based on these models  calculations and input data  a complex algorithm defines the output and hence the behaviour of the robot. \u200dHowever  as such the system cannot learn. Artificial intelligence systems provide robotics application new impressive perspectives  but also come with complex challenges. For aspects like vision and speech recognition  deep learning has drastically outperformed traditional methods. These approaches typically require massive amounts of labelled data and computational power. Although data is typically abundant in robotics  labelling is sparse and expensive. For the control of robots  reinforcement learning often requires significantly more iterations than are feasible on real systems.\u200d Therefore  a lot of the learning work is done in virtual environments  with challenges to transfer to the real world. Moreover  robots are interacting with the real world and challenges exist how to learn in a safe way  for the humans  for the environment and for the robot itself. \u200d Both methods  model-based control and learning methods  have disadvantages and advantages  and combining the best of both worlds is probably an interesting solution. Moreover like in animals and humans  due to millions years of evolution  the bodies are optimized for the tasks and the environment. Through a smart design with the use of new materials  actuators and sensor  part of the computational intelligence can be outsourced to the embodied intelligence\u202fof the robot body.\u200d According to the paradox of Moravec \u201cAI can quickly learn to perform tasks considered \"difficult\" by humans\u201d  such as complex statistics and analysis. However  on the other hand  tasks that are trivial for humans  are often still exceedingly difficult for computers and robots.\u201d Therefore instead of replacing humans by robots  there has been a lot of focus on developing collaborative robots to exploit these complementary strengths.

{"text": "A deep dive into reinforcement learning  Reinforcement learning concerns a distinct branch in the field of machine learning. While supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques learn based on a set of instances  reinforcement learning concerns an agent that learns by interacting with an environment. To illustrate this setting  consider a video game  where the agent identifies as the player of the game. The environment concerns the video game that can be controlled with a gamepad and observed by looking at the screen. The agent receives feedback from the environment in terms of rewards  for example via a game score. Based on this feedback and the observations of the environment  a reinforcement learning agent aims at learning to play the game optimally  by interacting repeatedly with the environment. In this course  we will study both the reinforcement learning problem and the algorithms that can be used to approach such problems. Over the last years  several important milestones were achieved using the reinforcement learning framework  such as learning to play ATARI 2600 video games  learning to play the board game Go to beat the number one human player and learning to reach grandmaster performance in the real-time strategy game Starcraft II. However  reinforcement learning is no longer limited to games  as many real-world problems can be formulated as a reinforcement learning problem. Recent studies used reinforcement learning to solve challenging problems such as wind farm control  epidemic mitigation  and robot control. In this course  we will convey the fundamentals that underlie reinforcement learning. To achieve this  we will start from intuition and applications to move towards formalisms that can implement a reinforcement learning agent. To move from formalisms to practice  we will explore these concepts in a grid-world environment using the python programming language. 10:00-12:00 Lecture13:00-15:00 Practical Session  Reinforcement learning is no longer limited to games, as many real-world problems can be formulated as a reinforcement learning problem.

{"text": "Physical dynamic systems learning from interactions with the real world  Physical dynamic systems like mechatronic systems face increasing challenges with respect to efficiency and quality. Higher levels of adaptivity and automation are required in an industry 4.0 setting. Control strategies based on expert knowledge and physics-based models are often suboptimal as not all physical phenomena might be properly incorporated. Also  the interactions of physical dynamic systems with varying environments bring about uncertainties. Reinforcement learning agents on the other hand allow to learn from interactions but demand expensive and sometime unsafe experimentation.  This talk presents recent algorithms and architectures at the intersection of classical control and reinforcement that allow physical dynamic systems to safely learn from interactions with the real world. The application of these methodologies on real-world mechatronic systems to improve efficiency and performance will be shown. https://www.vaia.be/en/courses/physical-dynamic-systems-learning-from-interactions-with-the-real-world#registrationForm Using algorithms and architectures at the intersection of classical control and reinforcement learning Webinar with Guillaume Crevecoeur (Ghent University)-Online-VAIA &amp; KU Leuven Stadius"}

{"text": "Behavioral approach to system theory  The behavioral approach to systems theory  put forward 40 years ago by Jan C. Willems  remained till recently an esoteric niche of research. The renewed interest in the last years is because of its unique suitability for the newly emerged data-driven paradigm  specifically the representation-free perspective on dynamical systems as sets of trajectories. A result derived in the behavioral setting that became known as the fundamental lemma started a new class of subspace-type data-driven methods. The fundamental lemma gives conditions for a non-parametric representation of a linear time-invariant system by the image of a Hankel matrix constructed from raw time series data. This course reviews the fundamental lemma  its generalizations  and related data-driven analysis  signal processing  and control methods. A prototypical signal processing problem considered in the course is interpolation and approximation of trajectories. It includes simulation  state estimation  and output tracking control as special cases. The theory leads to computationally tractable methods. Regularized version of the methods is robust to noise and model assumptions. Participants will get hands-on experience with the methods via Matlab exercises and individual work on mini-projects. The course consists of six 2.5-hour sessions. A session starts with an introduction  followed by questions-and-answers and exercises. After the third session  students will choose mini-projects to work on. The course will not cover a fixed curriculum and will be adapted as much as possible to the need and interests of the participants. An indicative outline of topics that will be discussed in the course is: Dynamical systems as sets of trajectoriesComplexity of a linear time-invariant systemParametric representations of a bounded complexity linear time-invariant systemControllability and control in the behavioral settingData-driven non-parametric model representationThe fundamental lemmaIdentifiability and the most powerful unfalsified modelGeneralizations of the fundamental lemmaData-driven interpolation and approximation of trajectoriesExistence and uniqueness of an exact interpolantMixed interpolation and approximationRecursive computationDealing with inexact/noisy dataNaive approach: using the pseudo-inverseStructured low-rank pre-processingNuclear-norm and \\(\\ell_1\\)-norm regularizationGeneralizations to nonlinear systemsPolynomial time-invariant systemsHammerstein  finite-lag Volterra  and bilinear systemsLinear time-invariant embeddingApplicationsInput estimationInternal navigationDynamic measurement  More info  Share this course   https://sites.uclouvain.be/socn/node/53 14 Nov 2022 - 9 Dec 2022 6-day course-Leuven-SOCN"}

{"text": "De-identification and anonymisation of sensitive data  Legitimacy of data-driven research and success of data-intensive applications depend on protecting privacy in the design  realisation  deployment and maintenance of these studies and systems. Personal Data Minimization (PDM) is a core principle of privacy protection  whereby the amount of personal data in data sets is adjusted to the level needed for the legitimate data usage in mind (i.e.  for the aimed study or system functionality). Mainly  Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) tools and mechanisms are used for the PDM of micro and tabular data sets. SDC technology aims at mitigating the disclosure of privacy sensitive information to adversaries who have access to the content of such data sets. Applying SDC methods is necessary before storing the data sets  sharing them with scientific community or partner organisations  or opening them to the public. Using a SDC tool  an expert can apply advanced SDC algorithms with proper parameters to a data set (i.e.  transform the data set)  gain insights into the utility of the original and the transformed data sets  estimate the data disclosure risks of the original and the transformed data sets  and eventually make appropriate trade-offs between the indicators of data utility and data disclosure risks. The task of applying SDC into practice  however  increasingly becomes difficult due to the growth of data volume  variety  velocity ... and the availability of background information to adversaries. Data growth makes it difficult to detect potential privacy issues hidden in data sets (relating to the intrinsic characteristics of data sets) and background information makes it difficult to assess the potential risks when combining sensitive data sets with other ones (relating to the extrinsic characteristics of data sets). prerequisite knowledge: Being familiar with basics of mathematicsUsed tools: ARX and ARXaaSDuration: Four half-day sessions (each of about 3 hours)  organized in two consecutive days 1: Introduction by Mortaza S.

{"text": "Artificial intelligence and contract formation  Consequently  the legal relevance of AI systems is growing rapidly  especially when these systems are used to support a party in the process of contract formation. This seminar focuses on four applications in which parties may consider an AI system\u2019s analysis in the decision (not) to conclude a contract. To begin with  AI systems are increasingly being used to support due diligence in M&A transactions. In an HR context  these systems are relied upon to analyse resumes or employee performance. AI systems are used as a contracting tool in the banking and insurance sector as well  e.g. to quickly assess the situation and work out an appropriate settlement that the other party is likely to accept. Finally  these systems can also be used in the art sector to assess the authenticity of a piece of art. These applications can help support the work of lawyers and in-house counsel. However  because AI systems are not flawless  they can also give rise to disputes. The resolution of such disputes depends on the difficult assessment of whether a party was entitled to rely on the AI system in given situation  and on the identification of the relevant legal regime. To facilitate this analysis  lawyers  company lawyers and judges may benefit from a basic understanding of the advantages and legal challenges of the use of AI systems to support contract formation  which will be discussed during this seminar. 09:00 - 09:10 uur: Opening remarks Prof. dr.

Our speakers  Prof. Sofie Van Hoecke (PreDiCT) and Matthias Feys (ML6)  will give you an overview of this field by tackling the following topics:  Why and when Hybrid AI is relevant for your situationAn overview of different ways to combine rules with machine learning models;Concrete examples where hybrid AI was implemented    Machine learning opened up new ways of solving technical challenges by training models on data instead of directly implementing rules & logic. This offers a lot of new opportunities for solving difficult problems. However, sometimes it can also be useful to combine these machine learning models with (expert) rules.

{"text": "The control room of the future:  AI empowered dashboards  A special focus will be given to control rooms as this sector is  increasing in importance with the digitization of operations. The  workshop covers three topics: Implementing AI in Control RoomsPredictive AnalyticsBusiness Integration (managerial focus) By Francesco Corman - Chair of Transport Systems at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology  ETH Zurich We review different challenges and opportunities for traffic control  in railway systems. From the point of view of sensing  state estimation  and data fusion must be performed in a very short time  and for units  that are typically spatially dispersed. From the point of view of  determining a control objective to support automatic decisions  the  challenge is how to understand the impact of a decision in terms of  system performance. Almost all of those problems have to deal with  unknown future states  which must be predicted  typically by model-based  or black box approaches  also based on advanced analytics. Once an  objective function and optimization variables are determined   optimization models can help to find a solution quickly and effectively.  Further challenges are the acceptance of decision stakeholders  within  the control room  but also within the travelers and operators  or the  direct implementation of automatic digital control. For  passenger-oriented traffic control  this is particularly interesting and  challenging  due to the large amount of possible decisions per decision  maker  and data that can partially describe those aspects  which calls  for machine learning approaches. To reach all those goals  the system  must have room for control  in another sense  flexibility in operations  must be built in already from the planning  to be exploited in the  real-time horizon when needed. by Leon Sobrie - On Track Lab Digitisation and employee workload (im)balance are intertwined. To address undesirable workload peaks and lows  we propose a 2-step machine learning model to provide real-time workload analytics per controller in digital safety-critical control rooms. The advocated model leverages a rich real-time data structure with disaggregated event-level taskload data. Next to exploring different machine and deep learning approaches  we compare the performance of a model that predicts aggregate workload with the performance of the aggregate of different models that predict specific task loads. We develop a business application that utilizes the proposed model to provide detailed predictive analytics that open the black box of workload imbalance and  in this way  empowers the control room manager with real-time insights. by Christophe Hurter - ENAC The Decision Making Process is already associated with AI. The algorithms are meant to help ATCOs in daily tasks  but they still face acceptability issues. Today\u2019s automation systems with AI/Machine Learning do not provide additional information on top of the Data Processing result to support its explanation  making them not transparent enough. The Decision Making Process is expected to become a \u201cWhite Box\u201d  giving understandable outcome through an understandable process. XAI SOLUTIONS: Transparency and Explainability: ARTIMATION\u2019s goal is providing a transparent and explainable AI model through visualization  data driven storytelling and immersive analytics. This project will take advantage of human perceptual capabilities to better understand AI algorithm with appropriated data visualization as a support for explainable AI  exploring in the ATM field the use of immersive analytics to display information. by Riccardo Patriarca - Sapienza Universit\u00e9 di Roma & Antonio Licu - Eurocontrol Modern systems are complex and understanding the nuances of everyday work requires to explore thoroughly system properties. EUROCONTROL recognized these needs when publishing its white papers on Resilience Engineering almost 15 years ago. The project called \u201cWeak Signal\u201d continued on that side. Besides the theoretical foundation on weak signals definition  detection and management  one of this project\u2019s outputs is the development of a novel tool called SECA (Structured Exploration of Complex Adaptations). SECA helps detecting weak signals in normal air traffic management operations  creating shared organizational knowledge. This latter arises from a collaborative elicitation process that span from tacit and explicit dimensions. SECA is designed to support data gathering and data analysis  integrating traditional thematic analyses with modern Natural Language Processing. The presentation will show the early results of its adoption in two different European ANSPs and the way to scale it up from a prototype to a full-fledged solution  also including the possibility to use the same approach in other industries.

None of the modules overlap in time  allowing students to engage at a reasonable pace  over the course of the first and second semester. This micro-credential focuses on the following learning outcomes. 1. The participant will have theoretical knowledge about the history and the main frameworks of Machine Learning. 2. The participant will have theoretical knowledge of the main machine learning algorithms and paradigms and will study some of them in depth. 3. The participant will be able to develop machine learning pipelines and set up their own machine learning experiments using Python modules. 4. The participant will have theoretical and practical knowledge of machine learning using neural networks. 5. The participant will understand the fundamental problems and approaches in automatic Natural Language Processing and know its history as a subfield within Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence. 6. The participant will have insight into the basic algorithms developed within NLP for morphological  syntactic  semantic  and discourse processing. 7. The participant will acquire hands-on experience with software for text categorization  language understanding  translation  and generation. All courses extensively rely on weekly  hands-on homework assignments  ensuring the acquisition of new  practical insights on a regular basis. The homework takes the form of engaging assignments on real-world datasets that challenge the students to apply the theoretical concept introduced during the interactive class sessions.The final evaluation of all three courses depends on project work  the goal and finality of which can be determined by the individual students  in close correspondence with the course teachers.An attractive feature of the evaluation of the NLP course (in the 2nd semester) is that students will participate in an ongoing shared task in the field.  Natural Language Processing is an integral component to applications of data science across the technological industry nowadays. Professionals in this domain, however, might struggle to keep up with the fast-paced developments in recent years. In particular the recent and impressive emergence of neural networks in machine learning as a go-to paradigm has rapidly altered the state of the art in artificial intelligence and challenges existing computational approaches to text. This micro-credential has been carved out as a balanced selection of contemporary modules from the MA in Digital Text Analysis that targets industry professionals who are interested in learning about modern machine learning and natural language processing.

{"text": "Human AI  Human processes of all kinds are complex and adaptive. Mental  social  and health-related processes can all change and adapt over time with human behaviour. Thought-based processes can change as a result of learning  social interactions can evolve over time  and health-related processes are susceptible to change too.This course will present theories and findings from a wide range of disciplines  including various branches of cognitive  social  health and neuroscience  to gain insight into underlying mechanisms of human processes that can be exploited in human AI modeling and simulation. The various scientific theories form a factual basis for modelling the processes. We can understand these often adaptive mechanisms through causal relations and causal pathways  which we can model as networks. Using this theoretical framework and the software provided  students can easily simulate a variety of scenarios.During the second week  students will carry out activities that could lay the foundations for a publication that can be finished later on in the course.This course introduces a network-oriented modelling approach based on adaptive networks. This approach is useful for modelling social interactions and mental and health-related processes within their respective networks.These network models cover the dynamics of causal effects  changing causal connections and excitability or sensitivity thresholds. Higher-order adaptiveness is another topic covered in the course  which includes the role of metaplasticity and the extent to which plasticity occurs in the field of cognitive neuroscience.Assessment is based on the assignments. In the second week of the course  a final assignment is addressed  which might be worked out to a paper that may be submitted to an international conference  where it could be presented and provided a publication.

{"text": "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence  In December 2017  Carnegie Mellon poker playing computer Libratus has stunned the world by winning 1.7M in a 20 days tournament against four poker stars. In a nutshell  Libratus is a decision-making agent that takes decisions in an uncertain environment  exploring the potential consequences of their own choices using complex estimates of the world around. This course is a study of the basic building blocks of decision-making agents  which are abstract entities living in an uncertain environment and are guided towards the realisation of given objectives. An agent is typically endowed with a knowledge base  a collection of facts expressed in some logical language  and an action repertoire at each state. The agent can reason about the environment  using their knowledge base  and take decisions accordingly. The environment is typically unknown  stochastic  and evolves following some rules that might be unknown to the agent  as well. On top of this  it is usually inhabited by other agents  which may or may not strive to achieve similar objectives. The task is to take the best possible decision that can be taken given the (incomplete) information available. This simple model is the basis of a number of important achievements in AI  and combines the use of logical  game-theoretic and algorithmic analysis.

{"text": "Commands for Self-Driving Cars &amp; Combining Vision and Language  We introduce a new task  unsupervised vision-language (VL) grammar induction. Given an image-caption pair  the goal is to extract a shared hierarchical structure for both image and language simultaneously. We argue that such structured output  grounded in both modalities  is a clear step towards the high-level understanding of multimodal information. Besides challenges existing in conventional visually grounded grammar induction tasks  VL grammar induction requires a model to capture contextual semantics and perform a fine-grained alignment. To address these challenges  we propose a novel method  CLIORA  which constructs a shared vision-language constituency tree structure with context-dependent semantics for all possible phrases in different levels of the tree. It computes a matching score between each constituent and image region  trained via contrastive learning. It integrates two levels of fusion  namely at feature-level and at score-level  so as to allow fine-grained alignment. We introduce a new evaluation metric for VL grammar induction  CCRA  and show a 3.3% improvement over a strong baseline on Flickr30k Entities. We also evaluate our model via two derived tasks  i.e.  language grammar induction and phrase grounding  and improve over the state-of-the-art for both. Authors: Bo Wan (Speaker)  Wenjuan Han  Zilong Zheng  Tinne Tuytelaars In recent years  we have seen significant steps taken in the development of self-driving cars. Multiple companies are starting to roll out impressive systems that work in a variety of settings. These systems can sometimes give the impression that full self-driving is just around the corner and that we would soon build cars without even a steering wheel. The increase in the level of autonomy and control given to an AI provides an opportunity for new modes of human-vehicle interaction. However  surveys have shown that giving more control to an AI in self-driving cars is accompanied by a degree of uneasiness by passengers. In an attempt to alleviate this issue  recent works have taken a natural language-oriented approach by allowing the passenger to give commands that refer to specific objects in the visual scene. Nevertheless  this is only half the task as the car should also understand the physical destination of the command  which is what we focus on in this paper. We propose an extension in which we annotate the 3D destination that the car needs to reach after executing the given command and evaluate multiple different baselines on predicting this destination location. Additionally  we introduce a model that outperforms the prior works adapted for this particular setting.

{"text": "Security &amp; Privacy of Artificial Intelligence Challenges and Solutions for Machine Learning Applications  1 : Introduction (4 April 10-13h) This module is an overall course introduction  sketching all the facets and aspects of securing a system or service in general  and of a data driven application based on ML in particular. Each of the major course modules will be briefly introduced and motivated. 2 : Security & Privacy (S&P) Engineering and Regulations (4 April  14-17.30h) Module 2A The covering of S&P requirements is a matter of running a significant security project  albeit efficiently. There is no such thing as the ultimate approach  but rather a range of measures and activities that can be applied to strengthen the S&P posture. This can be at the level of requirements and specification  at the level of coding  in security testing  etc. This module will cover the overall landscape and zoom into some of the most promising techniques. Relevant themes of this session include: Threat modelling and risk assessmentArchitectures and blueprintsRegulations and complianceModule 2B Security and privacy requirements are typically not only of a technical nature  they also and largely emerge from the demand to be compliant with policies and regulations. In the second module of Security & Privacy Engineering  we zoom into the most relevant regulations and discuss how we can work towards compliance. In addition  we discuss how this concern can be addressed as an integrated part of the overall development and engineering process.Z 3 : Cryptography: basic & advanced techniques (5 April  10-13h) Many protection techniques and technologies are at hand. It goes without saying that cryptography is an essential building block at the heart of data protection  and thus essential for the delivery of S&P requirements. The machine learning pipeline needs protection of training data  production data and models. This challenging environment demands for fairly advanced techniques. Module 3A In the module Cryptography I  we revisit the basics of cryptography to make sure that all attendants can refresh their existing knowledge on the subject matter. Module 3B In the module Advanced Cryptography and Data Protection  we elaborate on the most recent advances and techniques that can contribute to securing advanced data sharing in distributed AI. Relevant themes of this session include: Data storage in the new centuryData processing: an overview of cryptographic protectionMPC intro and applicationsFHE state-of-the-art and implicationsProtection of data in motion4 : Security and privacy posture of a Machine Learning architecture (5 April  14-17h) In this module  we revisit the architecture and operational environment of a machine learning application and analyze the values of contributions of known security techniques. Relevant themes of this session include: Attack surface: data  model  process and data flowThreat modelling for AI and known challengesAdversaries and their capabilitiesArchitectural and algorithmic defencesSecurity and privacy challenges in Federated Machine Learning5 : Adversarial Machine Learning (6 April  14-17h) In this module  we zoom into the specific challenge of achieving robustness and reliability when facing adversaries that attempt to fool the ML application by feeding disturbing data into  e.g. a classifier. This type of attack is typical to the setting of a ML environment and deserves significant attention. Relevant themes of this session include: Vulnerabilities in ML systems; overview of ML specific attacksProtection against adversarial examplesEvaluation and robustness of solutionsPrivacy aspects6 : Case Studies (7 April  10-13h) In this module  we discuss and analyze some case studies and apply the knowhow of this course to a specific application  for example in the context of authentication systems. Relevant themes of this session include: Face recognition revisitedBiometrics and challengesAnomaly detection7 : Workshops (7 April  14-17h & 8 April  10-17h) In this module  we organize \u2013 if so desired \u2013 interactive workshops with smaller groups of attendants who may share an interest in a common application domain. The goal is to validate which elements of the course can be applied to an application domain or case that is well understood by a team of course attendants. The practical approach and organization of this last module will depend on the engagement and input that is provided by the participants.

{"text": "Statistics and Econometrics Seminars  17 February 2022 Eugen Pircalabelu (UCLouvain) \"Unbalanced distributed estimation and inference for (covariate-adjusted) Gaussian graphical models\u201dA distributed estimation and statistical inference framework is introduced for the sparse precision matrix in the (covariate-adjusted) Gaussian graphical models under the un- balanced splitting setting. This type of splitting arises when the datasets from different sources cannot be aggregated on one single machine or when the available machines are of different powers. A de-biased estimator of the precision matrix on every single machine is proposed  and theoretical guarantees are provided. Moreover  a new de-biased estimator that is pooled across the machines using a composite likelihood approach is proposed. It is shown to enjoy consistency and asymptotic normality  and we provide statistical inference strategies based on it. The performance of this estimator is investigated via simulation studies and real data exam- ples. It is shown that the performance of this estimator is close to the non-distributed estimator  which uses the entire dataset. 12:00\u20131:00 pmon-campus (KU Leuven Faculty of Economics and Business HOGM 01.85) or online via Zoom (https://us02web.zoom.us/j/88418552909?pwd=MERhSDAvSVdET0xKWnpFOUxHOVJMUT09)24 February 2022 Elia Lapenta (ENSAE Paris) \u201cNonparametric instrumental variable estimation without smoothing on the instruments\u201d  We propose a new estimation method for nonparametric models identified by Instru- mental Variables (IVs). The estimation is based on a class of Generically Comprehensively Revealing functions. Compared to methods available in the literature that smooth on the IVs  our estimation does not smooth on the instruments and thus requires the selection of less tun- ing parameters. Furthermore  it does not suffer from a curse of dimensionality on the IVs. We show that our procedure is equivalent to a classical estimation method that smooths on the Ivs but keeps the bandwidth fixed as the sample size increases.  We then extend our methodology to estimate a partly linear model with endogenous variables. We obtain convergence rates for the estimator of the nonparametric part of the model and the asymptotic normality of the estimator of the parametric components. To deal with the ill- posedness of the inverse problem  we use a Landweber-Friedman regularization. This has the advantage of being a simple iterative method that avoids the inversion of a large matrix whose dimension increases with the sample size. We finally study the implementation of our proce- dure and propose a data-driven selection of the regularization and the smoothing parameters.

A clustering algorithm should be able  despite of this heterogene- ity  to extract discriminant pieces of information from the variables in order to design groups. In this work we introduce a multilayer architecture model-based clustering method called Mixed Deep Gaussian Mixture Model (MDGMM) that can be viewed as an automatic way to merge the clustering performed separately on continuous and non-continuous data. This architecture is flexible and can be adapted to mixed as well as to continuous or non-continuous data. In this sense we generalize Generalized Linear Latent Variable Models and Deep Gaussian Mixture Models. We also design a new initialisation strategy and a data driven method that selects the best specification of the model and the optimal number of clusters for a given dataset \u201con the fly\u201d. Besides  our model provides continuous low-dimensional representations of the data which can be a useful tool to visualize mixed datasets. Finally  we validate the performance of our approach comparing its results with state-of-the-art mixed data clustering models over several commonly used datasets.12:00\u20131:00 pmonline10 March 2022 Cavit Pakel (Bilkent University) \u201cBounds on average effects in discrete choice panel data models\u201d  Average effects in discrete choice panel data models with individual-specific fixed effects are generally only partially identified in short panels. While consistent estimation of the identified set is possible  it generally requires very large sample sizes  especially when the number of support points of the observed covariates is large  such as when the covariates are continuous. In this paper  we propose estimating outer bounds on the identified set of average effects. Our bounds are easy to construct  converge at the parametric rate  and are computationally simple to obtain even in moderately large samples  independent of whether the covariates are discrete or continuous. We also provide asymptotically valid confidence intervals on the identified set. Simulation studies confirm that our approach works well and is informative in finite samples. We also consider an application to labor force participation.

In addition  we use the bootstrap to generate plausible synthetic samples of data not seen in historical real data to create statistics of interest pertaining to uncertainty. While our approach is generic we focus on robust portfolio allocation problems as an application and study the impact of risk versus uncer- tainty in a dynamic mean-variance setting. We show that a mean-variance optimizing investor achieves economically meaningful wealth gains (33%) across our sample from 1996-2019 by internalizing our uncertainty measure during portfolio formation.

In this talk  we will address post-selection inference through approximate maximum likelihood estimation. Our goal is to: (i) efficiently utilize hold-out information from selection with the aid of randomization  (ii) bypass expensive MCMC sampling from exact conditional distri- butions that are hard to evaluate in closed forms. At the core of our new method is the solution to a convex optimization problem which assumes a separable form across multiple learning queries during selection. We illustrate the potential of our method across wide-ranging values of signal-to-noise ratio in simulated experiments. 12:00\u20131:00 pm  online31 March 2022 Limin Peng (Emory University) \u201cHeterogeneous individual risk modeling of recurrent events\u201d  Progression of chronic disease is often manifested by repeated occurrences of disease-related events over time. Delineating the heterogeneity in the risk of such recurrent events can provide valuable scientific insight for guiding customized disease management. In this paper  we propose a new sensible measure of individual risk of recurrent events and present a dynamic modeling framework thereof  which accounts for both observed covariates and unobservable frailty. The proposed modeling requires no distributional specification of the unobservable frailty  while permitting the exploration of dynamic effects of the observed covari- ates. We develop estimation and inference procedures for the proposed model through a novel adaptation of the principle of conditional score. The asymptotic properties of the proposed es- timator  including the uniform consistency and weak convergence  are established. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate satisfactory finite-sample performance of the proposed method. We illustrate the practical utility of the new method via an application to a diabetes clinical trial that explores the risk patterns of hypoglycemia in Type 2 diabetes patients. 5:00\u20136:00 pm  online21 April 2022 Angelo Guevara (Universidad de Chile) \u201cEndogeneity in discrete choice models\u201d  Endogeneity is the most severe failure that a discrete choice model can face in its objective of making causal inference or forecasting. It occurs when the explanatory variables are not independent of the error term and results in inconsistent estimators of the model pa- rameters. This seminar summarizes the causes  impact  and state of the art methods to detect and to address endogeneity in discrete choice models  which are related  but differ in relevant aspects  from those of linear model. The emphasis is put on providing the theoretical funda- mentals and the intuition behind the problems that may arise  as well as practical details as on how to apply the methods to address them  stressing the main considerations that must be taken in this endeavor. The main concepts are formally stated  and references are given to specific recent articles for further details that may be required for advanced applications or a deeper understanding. The seminar begins providing details on the definition  impact  causes and examples of endogeneity in discrete choice models  followed by a revision of possible approaches to detect this problem. Then  a deep review of the fundamentals  intuition and practicalities of the various methods that can be used to address endogeneity is presented  followed by a section providing insights and methods related to the obtention and validation of instrumental variables  which are key in this effort. The seminar continues then revising the problem of forecasting with discrete choice models that have been corrected for endogeneity  finalizing with a summary of the main conclusions and takeaways. 5:00\u20136:00 pmonline28 April 2022 Ce\u0301cile Adam (KU Leuven) \u201cLocal linear functional mean regression under censoring\u201d  Among the main interests in regression analysis is to explore the influence that a functional has on a real-valued variable of interest  the response. There is some literature on flexible mean regression  in which the targeted quantity is the conditional mean of the response given the functional. Another interest in statistics is to study the regression under the condition of censoring in which the values of the response are only partially known. After an introduc- tion to mean regression function estimation in which the response variable is subject to right random censorship  different statistical methodology are presented. The finite-sample perfor- mance of the estimators is investigated via a simulation study. (Joint work with I. Gijbels and G. Claeskens.) 12:00\u20131:00 pm  on campus 5 May 2022 Wiktor Budzinski (University of Warsaw) \u201cHybrid choice models vs. endogeneity of indicator variables: a Monte Carlo investigation\u201d  We investigate the problem of endogeneity in the context of hybrid choice (integrated choice and latent variable) models. We first provide a thorough analysis of potential causes of endogeneity and propose a working taxonomy. We demonstrate that although it is widely believed that the hybrid choice framework is devoid of the endogeneity problem  there is no theoretical reason to expect that this is the case. We then demonstrate empirically that the problem exists in the hybrid choice framework too. By conducting a Monte Carlo experiment  we display the extent of the bias resulting from measurement and endogeneity biases. Finally  we propose two novel solutions to address the problem: by explicitly accounting for correlation between structural and discrete choice component error terms (or with random parameters in a utility function)  or by introducing additional latent variables. Using simulated data  we demonstrate that these approaches work as expected  that is  they result in unbiased estimates of all model parameters. 12:00\u20131:00 pm online12 May 2022 Wendun Wang (Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam) \u201cRecovering spillover structures with structural breaks in panel data models\u201d  This paper aims at capturing time-varying spillover effects in a panel data setting. We consider panel models where the outcome of a unit not only depends on own characteristics and also the characteristics of other units (spillover effects). The effect of own characteristics can be unit-specific or homogeneous (common effects). We allow the spillover structure  i.e.  which units interact with which  to be latent  and the structure and effect of spillovers may both vary over time. We model time-varying spillovers via structural breaks with unknown break points. To estimate the break points  spillover and common effects  we solve a penalized least squares optimization and employ double machine learning procedures to improve the conver- gence and inference. We establish the super consistency of the estimated break point and provide the convergence rate of estimated spillover and common effects. We illustrate the theory via simulated and empirical data. 12:00\u20131:00 pm on-campus19 May 2022 Thierry Magnac (Toulouse School of Economics) \u201cLinear models with interval-censored explanatory variables\u201d  This paper studies the problem of inference in a set identified problem defined by linear moment restrictions with interval-censored variables.

{"text": "Adversarial Machine Learning  How can you tell the difference between elephants and lions? We  humans  will know for sure when we encounter one in the wild  but machines can nowadays make an excellent guess too. With more than 99.5% accuracy  modern machine learning algorithms know very well how to exploit visual features as best as possible. But  alas  that is not the complete picture: machines are easily fooled too. With some clever tricks  any picture of a lion can easily be manipulated in such a way that humans do not notice any difference  but that the machine learning model sees a completely different animal. Such a manipulated image is called an adversarial example.What is going on there? Have we built the most powerful machine learning models ever on brittle foundations?  The above is an example of adversarial learning  a subfield of machine learning that is concerned with what happens when we fool a machine learning model and how we can prevent and/or exploit this. While the first example here is mostly concerned with issues  an example of exploitation is found in the class of machine learning models called generative adversarial networks. Ever since the dawn of generative adversarial networks  the field of generative machine learning has taken multiple leaps forward and has paved the way to application domains we couldn\u2019t even think of before. When training generative adversarial networks  we let two machines play a game against each other: one machine gradually tries to become a master painter  while the other machine is the art critic that gets better and better at discerning genuine paintings from counterfeits. By making the painter try to fool the critic over and over again  the painter becomes more skilled and will produce more realistic paintings.
