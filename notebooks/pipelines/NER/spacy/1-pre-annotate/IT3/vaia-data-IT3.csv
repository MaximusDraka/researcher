Within the safety & security domain  it is a  challenge to inform individuals and organizations working together  around a common problem in such a way that activities can be developed. This means that sufficient information must be present to coordinate  activities  while access to information must be possible within the  network. Without these two conditions  it is impossible to address a  security threat or coordinate a crisis.  Those challenges create several issues regarding the coordination of  information  the integration of technology within and between  organizations and networks  the use of Generative Artificial  Intelligence to achieve better decision-making  etc. In this lecture   Mr. Chaara elaborates on these issues and tries to answer the challenges  posed.

Description This course aims to provide insight into basic statistical concepts with emphasis on practical applications. Mathematical formulae will be kept to a minimum. The theory and the methods of analysis will be extensively illustrated with examples relating to a wide variety of different fields. To emphasize the practical approach in this course all classes will take place in a pc room. The practical part of the first session (after the break) will be dedicated to getting to know the software package R. Participants are encouraged to participate in both parts. We start with concise graphical and numerical descriptions of data obtained from observational or experimental studies. The most common and frequently used probability distributions of discrete and continuous variables will be presented. Statistical inference draws conclusions about a population based on sampled data. Chance variations are taken into account such that a level of confidence is attached to these conclusions. We present the reasoning behind significance tests for the comparison of observed data with a hypothesis  the validity of which we want to assess. We apply this procedure to data obtained either from one or from two populations. The correct use of the t-test will be discussed. Nonparametric methods are considered as a possible alternative in case the requirements of the t-test are not met. We cover the basic concepts of hypothesis testing for categorical data  including the chi-square test. Quite often the relationship between two variables  where the outcome of one variable is seen as depending on the value of the other  is the focus of scientific interest. We will give an introduction to linear regression analysis  where a regression line based on observations obtained in a sample describes this relation. Hands-on exercises are worked out behind the PC using the R software. Target audience This course will benefit professionals and investigators from diverse areas  research scientists  clinical research associates  investing in data handling and wishing to acquire insight into basic statistical methods or to refresh their knowledge and practice of statistics.

Especially  we do not fully understand how ethical perceptions about AI influence both job applicants and the organizations that use AI for hiring purposes. In this session  we will discuss important aspects of using AI in hiring processes. First  we will discuss that AI is not created equally in terms of ethical perceptions. Indeed  people view the use of AI differently depending on what aspects of the hiring process it is used for (e.g.  analyzing CV vs. analyzing one’s social media). Then  we will discuss the influence of ethical perceptions of AI in hiring on the trust individuals put in organizations that use AI in hiring. We will focus on the importance individuals lend to AI performing its expected role  and how this expectation influences their ethical perceptions of AI  and in turn the trust they put on organizations using AI in hiring. Finally  we will further discuss whether and how ethical perceptions of using AI in hiring are related to individuals’ attraction to organizations that use AI in hiring. Circling back to the beginning of the session  we will discuss that the influence of ethical perceptions of using AI in hiring are not consistent across hiring methods. For example  only individuals who consider it ethical for organizations to use AI in intrusive ways  such as analyzing social media information for traits and characteristics  viewed such organizations as more attractive. |Ethical Perceptions of AI How Does it Matter for Hiring  Abstract of the lecture  The use of Artificial Intelligence AI entails enormous ethical challenges Especially  we do not fully understand how ethical perceptions about AI influence both job applicants and the organizations that use AI for hiring purposes In this session  we will discuss important aspects of using AI in hiring processes First  we will discuss that AI is not created equally in terms of ethical perceptions Indeed  people view the use of AI differently depending on what aspects of the hiring process it is used for eg  analyzing CV vs analyzing one’s social media Then  we will discuss the influence of ethical perceptions of AI in hiring on the trust individuals put in organizations that use AI in hiring We will focus on the importance individuals lend to AI performing its expected role  and how this expectation influences their ethical perceptions of AI  and in turn the trust they put on organizations using AI in hiring Finally  we will further discuss whether and how ethical perceptions of using AI in hiring are related to individuals’ attraction to organizations that use AI in hiring Circling back to the beginning of the session  we will discuss that the influence of ethical perceptions of using AI in hiring are not consistent across hiring methods For example  only individuals who consider it ethical for organizations to use AI in intrusive ways  such as analyzing social media information for traits and characteristics  viewed such organizations as more attractive  More info  Share this course   httpswwwvubbeeneventethicalperceptionsaihowdoesitmatterforhiring 26 Oct 2023 1400  1600 LectureBrusselVUB

Description R is a flexible environment for statistical computing and graphics  which is becoming increasingly popular as a tool to get insight in often complex data. While in some ways similar to other programming languages (such as C  Java and Perl)  R is particularly suited for data analysis because ready-made functions are available for a wide variety of statistical (classical statistical tests  linear and nonlinear modeling  timeseries analysis  classification  clustering  ...) and graphical techniques. The base R program can be extended with user-submitted packages  which means new techniques are often implemented in R before being available in other software. This is one of the reasons why R is becoming the de facto standard in certain fields such as bioinformatics (Bioconductor) and financial services. This course introduces the use of the R environment for the implementation of data management  data exploration  basic statistical analysis and automation of procedures. It starts with a description of the R GUI  the use of the command line and an overview of basic data structures. The application of standard procedures to import data or to export results to external files will be illustrated. Creation of new variables  subsetting  merging and stacking of data sets will be covered in the data management section. Exploration of the data by histograms  box plots  scatter plots  summary numbers  correlation coefficients and cross-tabulations will be performed. Simple statistical procedures that will be covered are: comparisons of observed group means (t-test  ANOVA and their non-parametric versions) and proportionstest for independence in 2-way cross tables and linear regression (focusing on the R-implementation of the statistical methods that are the subject of other modules of the statistics series)Finally  installing new packages and automation of analysis procedures will also be discussed. Practical sessions and specific exercises will be provided to allow participants to practice their R skills in interaction with the teacher. Target audience This course targets professionals and investigators from diverse areas with little to no R-programming experience who wish to start using R for their data manipulation  data exploration or statistical analysis.

However  these generative AI systems raise many ethical  epistemological  anthropological  psychological  economic  social  political and cultural questions. Some of these issues will continue to occur as these technologies are put to new uses  and it is not yet possible to predict all the effects they will have on individuals and society. Since the end of 2022  economic and political actors in several countries are discussing the impact of language models built with these generative AI systems. Some of these models have an impressive number of parameters. The race for the largest model is ongoing  but it is not certain that larger models would deliver higher performance. Laurence Devillers was involved as a co-writer of the opinion n°7 of the ethical issues of generative artificial intelligence in the CNPEN (National Pilot Committee for Digital Ethics). In this opinion  CNPEN focuses on the most important ethical issues in the light of current experience with generative AI systems  mainly on language models. |Ethical Issues of Generative AI  The social and economic impact of generative AI systems is likely to be major in many potential uses  for example in the environment or in healthcare However  these generative AI systems raise many ethical  epistemological  anthropological  psychological  economic  social  political and cultural questions Some of these issues will continue to occur as these technologies are put to new uses  and it is not yet possible to predict all the effects they will have on individuals and society Since the end of 2022  economic and political actors in several countries are discussing the impact of language models built with these generative AI systems Some of these models have an impressive number of parameters The race for the largest model is ongoing  but it is not certain that larger models would deliver higher performance Laurence Devillers was involved as a cowriter of the opinion n°7 of the ethical issues of generative artificial intelligence in the CNPEN National Pilot Committee for Digital Ethics In this opinion  CNPEN focuses on the most important ethical issues in the light of current experience with generative AI systems  mainly on language models  More info  Share this course   httpsdocsgooglecomformsde1FAIpQLScuYIQJpAnAvtUPNpHTotIuNFbeNLS1mV5dMlyDecEUx0FZQviewform 18 Oct 2023 1100  1200 lectureonlineCLARINBE

Corless|The name “Bohemian matrices” was proposed for a field that has actually been studied for many years now by different researchers, not recognizing their commonality. The name comes from an acronym for BOunded HEight Matrices, of Integers, although the restriction to integers has been subsequently relaxed.| The name “Bohemian matrices” was proposed for a field that has actually been studied for many years now by different researchers  not recognizing their commonality. The name comes from an acronym for BOunded HEight Matrices  of Integers  although the restriction to integers has been subsequently relaxed. The “height” of a vector is its infinity norm  and the “height” of a matrix A is the infinity norm of vec(A). The word “height” has been commonly used in the context of univariate polynomials expressed in the monomial basis: the height of a polynomial is the infinity norm of the vector of coefficients. We say “characteristic height” for the height of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix A. The idea is to restrict the study to families of matrices all of whose entries come from a finite (and hence bounded) set  called the population. Well-known examples include zero-one or binary matrices  Bernoulli matrices whose entries are either 1 or -1  and sign pattern matrices where the entries can be 1  0  or -1. One can then study Bohemian families of structured matrices  say upper Hessenberg Toeplitz Bohemian matrices  or complex symmetric tridiagonal Bohemian matrices  or symmetric matrices with entries from a restricted population  or Bohemian companion matrices  or other families. In this talk I will survey some known results  and discuss some problems that remain open. In particular  I will ask for help in finding algorithms to construct “minimal height” companion matrices for polynomials with integer coefficients; such things exist (possibly not uniquely) but there is no known good algorithm for constructing them. I will give examples where the height of the companion matrix is exponentially smaller (in the degree/dimension) than is the characteristic height. This seems interesting because lower height offers the hope of better eigenvalue conditioning. But even that is not well-understood. This is joint work with many people. |Bohemian Matrices An introduction and some open problems  The name “Bohemian matrices” was proposed for a field that has actually been studied for many years now by different researchers  not recognizing their commonality The name comes from an acronym for BOunded HEight Matrices  of Integers  although the restriction to integers has been subsequently relaxed The “height” of a vector is its infinity norm  and the “height” of a matrix A is the infinity norm of vecA The word “height” has been commonly used in the context of univariate polynomials expressed in the monomial basis the height of a polynomial is the infinity norm of the vector of coefficients We say “characteristic height” for the height of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix A The idea is to restrict the study to families of matrices all of whose entries come from a finite and hence bounded set  called the population Wellknown examples include zeroone or binary matrices  Bernoulli matrices whose entries are either 1 or 1  and sign pattern matrices where the entries can be 1  0  or 1 One can then study Bohemian families of structured matrices  say upper Hessenberg Toeplitz Bohemian matrices  or complex symmetric tridiagonal Bohemian matrices  or symmetric matrices with entries from a restricted population  or Bohemian companion matrices  or other families In this talk I will survey some known results  and discuss some problems that remain open In particular  I will ask for help in finding algorithms to construct “minimal height” companion matrices for polynomials with integer coefficients such things exist possibly not uniquely but there is no known good algorithm for constructing them I will give examples where the height of the companion matrix is exponentially smaller in the degreedimension than is the characteristic height This seems interesting because lower height offers the hope of better eigenvalue conditioning But even that is not wellunderstood This is joint work with many people  The name “Bohemian matrices” was proposed for a field that has actually been studied for many years now by different researchers not recognizing their commonality The name comes from an acronym for BOunded HEight Matrices of Integers although the restriction to integers has been subsequently relaxed httpshomesesatkuleuvenbesistawwwbdmbacktotherootsindexphpseminars Seminar by Robert M Corless seminarHeverlee LeuvenKU Leuven ESAT STADIUS

Professionals in this domain, however, might struggle to keep up with the fast-paced developments in recent years. In particular, the recent and impressive emergence of neural networks in machine learning as a go-to paradigm has rapidly altered the state of the art in artificial intelligence and challenges existing computational approaches to text. This micro-credential has been carved out as a balanced selection of contemporary modules from the MA in Digital Text Analysis that targets industry professionals who are interested in learning about modern machine learning and natural language processing. With an emphasis on project and teamwork, we develop practical applications on textual data, as well as solutions for the many issues that remain open in the field.| This micro-credential focuses on the following learning outcomes. 1. The participant will have theoretical knowledge about the history and the main frameworks of Machine Learning. 2. The participant will have theoretical knowledge of the main machine learning algorithms and paradigms and will study some of them in depth. 3. The participant will be able to develop machine learning pipelines and set up their own machine learning experiments using Python modules. 4. The participant will have theoretical and practical knowledge of machine learning using neural networks. 5. The participant will understand the fundamental problems and approaches in automatic Natural Language Processing and know its history as a subfield within Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence. 6. The participant will have insight into the basic algorithms developed within NLP for morphological  syntactic  semantic  and discourse processing. 7. The participant will acquire hands-on experience with software for text categorization  language understanding  translation  and generation. This micro-credential is a targeted subset from the MA in Digital Text Analysis and singles a teaching track in natural language processing. None of the modules overlap in time  allowing students to engage at a reasonable pace  over the course of the first and second semester. All courses extensively rely on weekly  hands-on homework assignments  ensuring the acquisition of new  practical insights on a regular basis. The homework takes the form of engaging assignments on real-world datasets that challenge the students to apply the theoretical concept introduced during the interactive class sessions.The final evaluation of all three courses depends on project work  the goal and finality of which can be determined by the individual students  in close correspondence with the course teachers.An attractive feature of the evaluation of the NLP course (in the 2nd semester) is that students will participate in an ongoing shared task in the field.

Authors of accepted abstracts will have the opportunity to submit a full paper after the conference to CLIN Journal. CLIN33 organizes a shared task on the Automatic Detection of AI-Generated Texts. With the surge of powerful automatic content generation comes the important task of distinguishing texts generated by language models from texts written by humans. Therefore  the CLIN33 shared task invites you to contribute to the development of automatic detection systems of AI-generated texts. The shared task consists of two tracks.  Visit the shared task website for more information Detection Track In this track you will develop a system that detects whether a document is generated by a language model or written by a human. The system will be evaluated on a test dataset that will remain hidden. For tuning your system you will be provided with a sample of the test data as a development set. Your system will be submitted as a notebook (colab or jupyter) and be self-containedThe test data will not be sharedYou will be provided with a subset of the test data for validation and developmentNo training data will be provided  you are expected to create your own when using Machine LearningThere will be a scoreboard for testing your model on the validation data that you can use to monitor progress during developmentThere will be three genres of text: newspaper text  tweets  and poemsThe text will be generated by different language models (we will provide information about which models later)The generated text will be produced using different prompt engineering strategies (standard  academic level  middle school level  human-like  ...)There will be an English and a Dutch subtrack. Participants are expected to participate in both. There will be a prize for the team that develops the best performing system averaged over both languages and all conditions. Explanation Track (optional) In this track  you will provide a qualitative analysis  empirically supported by the output of your system on the validation set  of the knowledge used by your model to solve the task. This explanation can be in terms of statistical properties or in terms of linguistic patterns and phenomena and will the form of a short paper (4 pages max). This track will be evaluated by the organizers  extended with additional judges representing the users of detection systems (for example teachers or editors).

They arise in applications such as optimization, statistics and quantum physics, where they extend the ubiquitous role of toric geometry.

Over 56% of the world population now lives in cities  and this number can go as high as 97% in Belgium. In parallel  technology plays an increasingly important role in these environments. Specifically: Artificial intelligence  Data  and Robotics have become an integral part of living in cities. We may not always be aware of their presence  but they are playing a critical role in our daily commutes  government services  local stores  or in the public space. Concepts such as ""smart cities"" have emerged and reflect the continuing desire of cities to implement these technologies on a large scale to address local challenges - one of which is  of course  becoming even more sustainable. AI and data are now being actively used in a variety of areas  from energy sharing to biodiversity monitoring. Despite these hopes  growing concerns have emerged about the overall inhibiting impact of these technologies on sustainability. In addition  ethical and legal concerns have emerged  to the point where cities enact local responsible use principles  also insisting on greater citizen inclusion. This conference will investigate if and how AI  Data  and Robotics  can become local and are truly sustainable for cities. The FARI Brussels Conference agenda is continuously being updated and improved to give you the best and most insightful conference experience. We will release the final program and presentation titles weeks before September 11  but here's a sneak peak of what is cooking!

TUESDAY | Handwritten Text Recognition Transkribus  TEI-XML On the second day  we will recap what we have learned about HTR  and we will focus more specifically on the workflow in Transkribus. Then  we will do a creative exercise: writing a short story by hand. This will be the material to work with during the day as we will run the HTR model to 'transcribe' your own handwriting. In the end  we will export the results in TEI-XML. WEDNESDAY | Keystroke Logging Inputlog  keystroke logging  TEI-XML On the third day  we will build upon the creative exercise of Tuesday: we will revise the short story on the computer and logging the writing process with a keystroke logger. We will then use these keystroke logging files to learn the basic technologies involved in making a (genetic) digital edition. As a first step  we will encode all the textual operations (e.g.  new text production  additions  deletions) in TEI-XML together with the timestamps of each operation. These XML files will be used the next day as we move on to the visualisation of the reconstructions of the digital writing processes. THURSDAY | eXist-db eXist-db app  HTML  CSS On the fourth day  we will learn the basics of working with eXist-db. After jointly installing eXist-db  we will use a pre-made eXist-db application  which can visualise the keystroke logging transcription. In the afternoon we will visit a museum. FRIDAY | Visualising Manuscripts and Born-Digital Writing Processes XPath  XSLT  HTML  CSS On the last day  we will build upon what we have learned in the eXist-db session to visualise the writing process. We will learn the basics of XPath and XSLT as well as HTML and CSS  to make modifications to the existing visualisation. We will end the day with a final discussion. Upon successful completion of the summer school course (including the preparatory assignment)  students will be credited 3 ECTS — the certificates of which they can present to their home institutions. Students who wish to earn 6 ECTS instead  will receive an additional assignment that will be completed individually over the summer. In this assignment  students will be asked to apply what they learned to their own materials  and develop their own small-scale demo edition. To include the credits in the curriculum at the home institution  participants need an agreement with the responsible person at the home institution.

Thus  one can use DNN for image processing  actions recognition  text classification  language processing  speech recognition  etc. However  this high success of DNN models is accompanied by a high increase of computation time  architecture complexity  and memory storage. Moreover  the deployment and exploitation of DNN models in real environments is generally related to connected sensors (cameras  microphones  temperature sensors  etc.) where the inference process needs to be executed in real time on embedded or edge resources. In this work  we present an overview of the three main compression methods (pruning  quantization  knowledge distillation) that allow to reduce the computation time and memory size of DNN models while keeping a high accuracy. Experimental results are conducted within image classification  object detection and actions recognition with DNN models that were optimized and deployed on Edge AI resources such as Jetson Nano  Jetson Xavier and Jetson Orin. The obtained results showed that we could reach a compression factor of around 6x while keeping a good accuracy  and we also observe a speedup of 3x compared to non-compressed models.

It is meant to provide a place for the discussion of the most recent developments in optimisation in machine learning problems, and the exploration of new research directions in this field.| 13:00 - 13:40 Optimization of macro-at-k metrics in multi-label classification(Prof. dr. Krzysztof Dembczyński — Yahoo! Research  USA aned Poznań University of Technology  Poland) We consider a problem of optimizing macro-averaged complex performance metrics in multi-label classification  that is metrics linearly decomposable into a sum of binary classification utilities applied separately to each label. We focus on tasks in which the algorithm is required to predict exactly k labels for each instance  leading to macro-at-k metrics. The constraint couples the otherwise independent binary classification tasks  leading to a much more challenging optimization problem than standard macro-averages. We analyze the problem in two different statistical regimes  namely in the expected test utility (ETU) and the population utility (PU) frameworks. The former aims at optimizing the expected performance on a given test set  while the latter optimizes the performance on a population level. For both frameworks we derive optimal prediction rules and practical algorithmic solutions with provable statistical guarantees. Empirical results provide evidence for the competitive performance of the proposed approaches.   13:40 - 14:20 On extensions of loss minimisation for training uncertainty-aware predictors (Prof. dr. Eyke Hüllermeier — LMU Munich  Germany) Due to the steadily increasing relevance of machine learning for practical applications  many of which are coming with safety requirements  the notion of uncertainty has received increasing attention in machine learning research in the recent past. This talk will address questions and challenges regarding the representation and adequate handling of (predictive) uncertainty in (supervised) machine learning. A specific focus will be put on the distinction between two important types of uncertainty  often referred to as aleatoric and epistemic. In this regard  a recent generalisation of the common (empirical) loss minimisation approach in machine learning will be critically anaysed and shown to be fundamentally flawed.   14:20 - 15:00 Learning from user and environment in combinatorial optimisation (Prof. dr. ir. Tias Guns — KU Leuven  Belgium) Industry and society are increasingly automating processes  which requires solving combinatorial optimisation problems. To find not just optimal solutions  but also 'desirable' solutions for the end user  it is increasingly important to offer AI tools that automatically learn from the user and the environment and that support the constraint modelling in interpretable ways. In this talk I will provide an overview of three different ways in which AI can augment the modeling part of combinatorial optimisation. This includes learning from the user (preference learning in VRP)  learning from the environment (end-to-end decision focussed learning) and explanation generation  that sit at the intersection of learning and reasoning. As part of this work  we are building a modern constraint programming language called CPMpy(http://cpmpy.readthedocs.io) that eases integration of multiple constraint solving paradigms with machine learning and other scientific python libraries. I will shortly highlight its possibilities beyond the above cases  as well as our larger vision of conversational human-aware technology for optimisation.   16:00 - 18:00 Efficient algorithms for set-valued prediction in classification (Public PhD defence ir. Thomas Mortier — Ghent University)  In recent years  the use of machine learning has gained popularity in solving complex tasks across multiple domains  including robotics  healthcare  biology and finance. However  with the increasing amount of data and complexity of tasks  the notion of uncertainty has become of major importance in machine learning. The ability to represent uncertainty in an efficient and trustworthy way should therefore be considered as a key feature of any machine learning method. This thesis aims to address this challenge by focusing on the development of principled tools to efficiently represent uncertainty in machine learning. In particular  the concept of set-valued prediction is highlighted  which provides end-users with multiple answers instead of a single answer with little guarantee. To this end  probabilistic classification is considered  where the unknown relationship between inputs and classes is assumed to be non-deterministic and expressed by a conditional class distribution. A distinction between several settings in classification is made and different biological applications are considered  including large-scale bacterial species identification using Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) data. |Optimisation in Machine Learning  1300  1340 Optimization of macroatk metrics in multilabel classificationProf dr
