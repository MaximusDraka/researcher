Core Qualifications           C, C++, C#, SQL pl/sql  Operating Systems: Windows, Linux, unix  HDL/HVL: Verilog, SystemVerilog  Scripting Language: Unix Shell Scripting, PERL, Python, TCL  Software proficiency: Cadence (Layout, Virtuoso, Spectre),  Synopsys(DC Compiler), Modelsim, Questasim, TFS for version controller, Microsoft sql server 2012, Visual studio 2008                         Accomplishments       Design and simulation of basic CMOS circuits using Cadence Virtuoso Tool In a series of Labs, we worked on basic cell characterization and transient, dc response analysis.  We tested the device under test (DUT) for various fanouts and observed their responses.  Using these schematics we developed physical layouts Debugging DRC , LVS errors correct them and generated successful DRC and LVS report.  also extracted  parasitic capacitance and evaluated PEX reports and power reports for average power.  FIFO Controller using System Verilog The FIFO Controller is designed with distinct address and data buses such the data in and out rate are the same.  Corner cases are also tested using multiple combinations.  Verilog and SystemVerilog Projects October 2016 to Present Sequence detector and generator, Two out of Five Error code detector, 2n priority encoder and a n bit iterative comparator in SystemVerilog.  Many designs are implemented as Finite State Machines Designed shift registers, gray code to binary converters and state machines Designed a digital scoreboard in Verilog Designed a digital scoreboard  using BCD adders, clock dividers and push button conditioning logic which increments from 0 -99 and decrements the other way round at every button push.The reset condition occurs only after 5 successive taps so as to avoid any glitches in the score.  Design and synthesis of a basic circuit to understand STA: Developed RTL code for basic circuits in SystemVerilog - Synthesized the code using Synopsys DC.using TCL commands- Timing analysis and Setup time Hold time Violations checked and generated timing reports using SDF and SDC file Cellphone operated Land Rover using DTMF: This concept is taken from military application where such land rover works as Unmanned Guided vehicle (UGV) for spy operations, bomb detector etc., such application the movements of land rover can be controlled from very far remote and safe place (as there is practically no limitation on operating range).  Here, A land rover is controlled by the DTMF tunes sent from a cellphone.  A Land Rover would move based on the tunes received in forward, backward manner, left or right by rotating both DC motors.  DC Motor Driver receives actuating signals from micro controller in terms of high/low logic, amplifies (current) it and rotates 2 DC motors in both directions 2- Walk Forward 6- Left turn 4- Right turn 8- Walk backwards This robot can be used in commercial areas like 1.
