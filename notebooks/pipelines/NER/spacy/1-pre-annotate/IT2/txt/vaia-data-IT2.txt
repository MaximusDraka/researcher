Enabling the future of work  This course will be given by Prof Rob Heyman on Friday 22 March 2024 from 930 to 1630 CET at the FARI Test  Experience Center Cantersteen 16  1000  Brussels The problems or challenges we wish to address in this 1day course are Adopt AI or die there is a push to use a form of artificial  intelligence for each organization  and failure to do so seems to imply  the end of your organization's history But how do you ensure that your  investments in AI are sustainable and successfully adopted by your  colleagues and employees While you are adapting to this new technological context  you will also have to deal with new regulations How will you do this Lastly  adopting technological and legal change is not something you  do on your own  so what are methods to facilitate this change in your  organization While not absolutely necessary  it helps to have a clear challenge in  mind when joining this session Rob will invite you to work on your  innovation case or with someone in case you lack one Knowledge of legal frameworks or AI is not necessary Session 1 How to and how not to Introduce Automation on the Work Floor We will look at practical  theoretical concepts to understand  innovation on the work floor and the tension between users and  technology The aim is to understand all successful technology  adoptions as innovations that change users' daily practices Next  we discuss cases where AI or industry 40 applications were  introduced and what these meant for different stakeholders If you have a  case  you wish to discuss  be sure to contact Rob Heyman to discuss  this as part of the session Session 2 Boosting Operational Efficiency by Reducing Digital Friction and Increasing Agility If you believe innovation can only be successful if practices change  then it follows that regulations can only be successful if regulations change practices  too In this part we look at the particular challenges we experienced during the implementation of the GDPR and what this might mean for the implementation of the AI Act Session 3 Improving Information Protection and Governance During the last part of the day  we will use a case for innovation of your choosing and define a workshop or process to include colleagues and employees in this process In this interactive part  you will learn a few facilitation methods and the key ingredients to define cocreation projects on your work floor This training was designed for decision  makers from public organizations that want to fully empower workforces  with flexible digital workplaces  increased agility and stronger  information protection to address current business needs and evolving  challenges As FARI is supported by the European Resilience  Recovery Fund RRF  we can continue to offer free access to participants from public administrations public institutions and research institutions We can also provide a 50 discount to participants from the following target groupsEducational institutionsNGOs and nonprofit organisationsBrussels based companiesBrussels citizens  More info  Share this course   httpswwwfaribrusselseducationenablingthefutureofwork 22 Mar 2024 0930  1630 1day courseBrusselsFARI
A new symbolicnumeric method to solve the multiparameter eigenvalue problem  In this talk  we focus on polynomial systems coming from the multiparameter eigenvalue problem and certain generalizations Using the theory of resultants and Weyman complexes  we present new matrices of optimal size for solving these systems This talk is based on joint work with Jean Charles Faugère  Angelos Mantzaflaris  and Elias Tsigaridas  A classical approach to solving polynomial systems is to linearize the problem and reduce it to an eigenvalue calculation For this purpose certain families of special matrices are used eg Sylvester and Dixon matrices Their size and structure determine how far these methods can go therefore it is essential to construct better matrices for the specific systems that arise in practice  httpshomesesatkuleuvenbesistawwwbdmbacktotherootsindexphpseminars Seminar by Matías R Bender CMAP École Polytechnique seminarHeverlee LeuvenKU Leuven ESAT STADIUS

Explaining and Predicting Outcomes with Linear Regression    Explaining and Predicting Outcomes with Linear Regression                               Linear regression addresses how a continuous dependent variable is associated by one or more predictors of any type The fact that many practical problems deal with continuous outcomes eg income  blood pressure  temperature  affect makes linear regression a popular tool  and most of us will be familiar with the concept of drawing a line through a cloud of data points The first two sessions of this module introduce the conceptual framework of this method using the simple case of a single predictor Formulas and technicalities are kept to a minimum and the main focus is on interpretation of results and assessing model validity This includes confidence statements on the predictor effect hypothesis tests and confidence intervals  using the regression model to predict future results and verification of model assumptions In session 3 and 4 we allow for more than one predictor leading to the multiple linear regression model We focus on either explanation or prediction How to come to a parsimonious model starting from a large number of predictors will be discussed in detail In these complex linear models special attention will be given to interpreting individual predictor effects  as they critically depend on other terms in the model and underlying relations between predictors confounding In the last session a more elaborate data analysis is discussed We touch on problems where linear regression is not appropriate and replaced by related approaches such as generalized linear models and mixed models Different features will be illustrated with case examples from the instructors practical experience  and participants are encouraged to bring examples from their own work Handson exercises are worked out behind the PC using the R software Target audience This course targets professionals and investigators from all areas who are involved in prediction problems or need to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more explanatory variables Fees The participation fee is 1100 EUR for participants from the private sector Reduced prices apply to students and staff from nonprofit  social profit  and government organizations An exam fee of 35 EUR will be applied Industry  private sector  profession € 1100Non profit  government  higher education staff € 825Doctoral students  unemployed € 495 If two or more employees from the same company enrol simultaneously for this course a reduction of 20 on the course fee is taken into account starting from the second enrolment Registration More information and registration on our BetaAcademy website  Explaining and Predicting Outcomes with Linear Regression httpsbetaacademyugentbeenprogramshortandlongrunninginitiatives202320242024m11lrmodule11explainingandpredicting Explaining and Predicting Outcomes with Linear Regression courseGhentUGent

KG3D Learning and Reasoning Webinar  by Simon Vandevelde Operational decisions are an important part of knowledgeintensive organizations  as these are taken in a high volume on a daily basis However  describing these decisions in a standardized format such as DMN is a timeconsuming task  as various textual sources need to be analyzed In this talk  we present the results of our experiments on an automated approach to generating decision tables from natural language based on the GPT3 LLM Through a total of 72 experiments over six problem descriptions  we evaluated GPT3's decision logic modeling and reasoning capabilities While GPT3 demonstrates promising abilities in extracting decision context and identifying relevant variables from natural language  further enhancements are needed to improve its decision table capabilities for efficient automation of DMN modeling by Ioannis Dasoulas An abundance of tabular data exists and is used by a wide range of applications However  a big portion of these data lack the semantic information necessary for users and machines to properly understand them This lack of table semantic understanding impedes their usage in data analytics pipelines Existing solutions are focused on specific annotation tasks and types of tables  and rely solely on large knowledge bases  making it difficult to reuse in realworld settings In this talk  we present TorchicTab  aversatile semantic table interpretation system able to annotate tables with varied structures by using either an external knowledge graph  such as Wikidata  or annotated tables with predefined terms for training The results demonstrate TorchicTab's ability to produce accurate annotations for different tasks across varied datasets  More info  Share this course   httpskg3dcskuleuvenbeevents 26 Feb 2024 0900  1015 webinaronlineKG3D KU Leuven

ChatGPT and Co in higher education to be cheered or feared    Artificial Intelligence takes many forms One of those of widest  relevance for our universities is the passionately discussed chatbot  application ChatGPT  launched in November 2022 by OpenAI In a matter of  seconds  it can produce texts that sound like wellinformed answers to  any possible question  react to users' objections and summarize long  texts Its potential is evident in many fields  including all aspects of  university life    But it also constitutes  along with related AI applications  a  formidable challenge  not least for the way we teach and evaluate our  students The texts ChatGPT generates  whether concise or richly  developed  often seem to provide students with all they need to perform  many tasks currently assigned to them as homework  tests or exams  Should we regulate  restrict or even forbid their use of ChatGPT    Should we on the contrary encourage our students to use it and  radically redesign how we evaluate them Should we even rethink in depth  what we need to teach them why bother trying to teach them to write  texts in their own and other languages if ChatGPT can do that far better  for them Should we concentrate instead on teaching our students  critical thinking skills    Or should we rather be primarily worried about the unwarranted trust  which our students will unavoidably nourish for ChatGPT's answers  or  about the many biases that affect unwittingly the information that is  reaching them  or about the huge ecological cost of the worldwide  operation of AI applications  Organizing committee  P Van Parijs coordinator  JM Chaumont  E De Keuleneer  MC de Marneffe  B De Munck   H Garmyn  P Goethals  JP Lambert  Q Michel  B Seghers  D Willems  J Willems  The potential of artificial intelligence applications like ChatGPT is evident in many fields including all aspects of university life but it also constitutes a formidable challenge not least for the way we teach and evaluate our students Should we encourage our students to use it and radically redesign how we evaluate them Or should we rather be worried about the unwarranted trust in it or about the many biases that affect the information that is reaching them httpswwwethicalforumbe Should academics fear or cheer ChatGPT and its cognates seminarBrusselsKU Leuven UGent UCLL Ethical Forum
