Fired with three 500,000 BTU open flame natural gas burners, the 1,500 gallon kettle reaches optimal boil in 45 minutes. At that point, thermal sensors trigger the burner and damper control systems to adjust automatically, allowing reduced BTU output and slowing of the exhaust gases for maintenance of the optimal boil. Heat recovery coils were placed in the flue gas path for heating facility water supplies, extracting as much remaining energy as possible from the burn. This kettle is still in use after twenty-seven years and is producing over 500,000 gallons of product annually.   Heat Treating Chamber:  Working with design criteria and client’s engineers, a 5,400 cubic foot heat treating oven for honeycomb core carbon fiber sheets and high gloss flat sheet products was designed and fabricated from high temperature stainless steel and installed in the client’s facility. The chamber, approximately 15 feet wide, 20 feet deep, and 18 feet high, had a 8 inch thick pressurized water jacket circulating more than 12,000 gallons of treated water at 100 pounds per square inch, and a hydraulically operated door weighing in excess of 15 tons. The internal atmosphere of pure argon was heated to temperatures exceeding 2,200 degrees during the heat-treating process.   Extrusion Punching Fixture:  To update one of his employer’s outdated manufacturing processes for punching their custom extruded materials, Mr. Claire designed and himself fabricated custom tooling and fixturing for punching precision progressive hole patterns in aluminum extrusions. The design process consumed nearly 4 months, and manufacturing another 3 months, and the resulting modular fixture accepted 15 different shaped extrusions and punched a maximum of 6 different hole sizes and patterns, with 4 spacing options within each pattern, per extruded shape. This fixture allowed for consolidation of multiple operations, which previously had been done in several steps in multiple machines, into one streamlined process using only one of the company’s existing machines instead of six, while at the same time creating flexibility for new extruded shapes. By eliminating out-of-tolerance issues created by multiple handlings of the same piece, which frequently occurred with the older processes, scrapped material was reduced by nearly 60%. Additionally, setup times decreased by 80% by utilizing a series of electro-pneumatic mechanisms which the operator controlled with a series of selector switches that determined the shape, pattern, and spacing being punched. After being loaded onto the in-feed rollers, the lengths of materials were automatically fed through the fixture for punching once the cycle had been initiated by the operator.|none
