Well, technically, they pay us to market more effectively. And, strangely (!), that often means marketing a lot less.   How? We use a lot of math and a lot of machine learning to decide which people on their subscriber lists actually want to hear from them right now.   When you do this, two things happen. Brands save a ton of money. And their deliverability improves (hello inbox, goodbye spam filter!).   Fewer messages sent + higher chance they will be seen = ROI goes way up.   Sounds simple, right? Well, it’s not. You try getting marketers to be less market-y. It’s way easier to “play it safe” and email everyone all the time. Our math has to be that good.   But you said there would be math. Yes. We said there would be math.   And that’s where you come in. We need people with amazing neural networks in their heads to help program our artificial ones. You’ll be one of the founding members of our machine learning team. You’ll have a huge impact on our product, our culture, and building something great from the ground up. It will be a lot of fun.   About the Role:  You will be on a team of engineers, reporting to our CTO Zack (he has a Master’s in CS from Georgia Tech) and working closely with our CEO and Head of Product Daniel (he has a PhD in Neurobiology and has built data science teams for a decade). We look like a SaaS company. But we’re really building the data science and machine learning company to support the world’s best brands.   As a Full Stack Engineer, you will:   Design, implement, test, deploy, and iterate on end-to-end features in our products covering both frontend and backend  Create intuitive dashboards and user interfaces, bringing simplicity to complex user needs  Integrations and APIs oh my: establish data feeds for our ML models and make their outputs take action in the real world  Produce clean and well-structured code with detailed specifications and documentation  Help maintain code quality, organization, automation, and continuous delivery    Your Ideal Background  Please apply even if you don’t meet every requirement   Solid understanding of Python, Flask, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, React.js  A versatile builder who has built and maintained a web application from scratch  6+ years of industry experience in backend development    5+ years in frontend development - you can translate complex concepts into user-friendly interfaces  Strong system design fundamentals and experience building scalable systems  Proven software engineering skills in a production environment, including test-driven development  Your code is comprehensible, well-structured, and highly performant  Strong sense of responsibility and ownership and own projects end to end with a bias for solving problems and shipping impactful features into production that are well tested (unit & end-to-end)  Strong analytical and problem-solving skills    Bonus points for experience in the following:   Experience building data-intensive applications  Previous CTO of a startup or Founding Engineer experience    Where you’ll work: Remotely in the NYC Area, with occasional in-person meetings until we get a coworking space in the future.   Ortia Offers:  Orita offers an array of benefits, including competitive salaries, 401K, equity in a fast-growing startup, and a flexible PTO policy.   The base salary range for this full-time position is $175,000 - $230,000 + equity + benefits (healthcare, 401K, etc.).

Well, technically, they pay us to market more effectively. And, strangely (!), that often means marketing a lot less.   How? We use a lot of math and a lot of machine learning to decide which people on their subscriber lists actually want to hear from them right now.   When you do this, two things happen. Brands save a ton of money. And their deliverability improves (hello inbox, goodbye spam filter!).   Fewer messages sent + higher chance they will be seen = ROI goes way up.   Sounds simple, right? Well, it’s not. You try getting marketers to be less market-y. It’s way easier to “play it safe” and email everyone all the time. Our math has to be that good.   But you said there would be math. Yes. We said there would be math.   And that’s where you come in. We need people with amazing neural networks in their heads to help program our artificial ones. You’ll be one of the founding members of our machine learning team. You’ll have a huge impact on our product, our culture, and building something great from the ground up. It will be a lot of fun.   About the Role:  You will be on a team of engineers, reporting to our CTO Zack (he has a Master’s in CS from Georgia Tech) and working closely with our CEO and Head of Product Daniel (he has a PhD in Neurobiology and has built data science teams for a decade). We look like a SaaS company. But we’re really building the data science and machine learning company to support the world’s best brands.   As a Full Stack Engineer, you will:   Design, implement, test, deploy, and iterate on end-to-end features in our products covering both frontend and backend  Create intuitive dashboards and user interfaces, bringing simplicity to complex user needs  Integrations and APIs oh my: establish data feeds for our ML models and make their outputs take action in the real world  Produce clean and well-structured code with detailed specifications and documentation  Help maintain code quality, organization, automation, and continuous delivery    Your Ideal Background  Please apply even if you don’t meet every requirement   Solid understanding of Python, Flask, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, React.js  A versatile builder who has built and maintained a web application from scratch  6+ years of industry experience in backend development    5+ years in frontend development - you can translate complex concepts into user-friendly interfaces  Strong system design fundamentals and experience building scalable systems  Proven software engineering skills in a production environment, including test-driven development  Your code is comprehensible, well-structured, and highly performant  Strong sense of responsibility and ownership and own projects end to end with a bias for solving problems and shipping impactful features into production that are well tested (unit & end-to-end)  Strong analytical and problem-solving skills    Bonus points for experience in the following:   Experience building data-intensive applications  Previous CTO of a startup or Founding Engineer experience    Where you’ll work: Remotely in the NYC Area, with occasional in-person meetings until we get a coworking space in the future.   Ortia Offers:  Orita offers an array of benefits, including competitive salaries, 401K, equity in a fast-growing startup, and a flexible PTO policy.   The base salary range for this full-time position is $175,000 - $230,000 + equity + benefits (healthcare, 401K, etc.).
