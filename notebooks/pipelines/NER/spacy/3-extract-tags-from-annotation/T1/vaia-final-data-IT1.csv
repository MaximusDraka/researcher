For those working with AI on a daily basis, staying up to date with the newest techniques within various domains is a challenge. In this seminar series, academic experts will bring you up to speed with the hottest topics: Advanced GenAI, Knowledge Graphs, MLOps and AI@Edge. All seminars include a hands-on component.| Advanced GenAI (17 April 2024  12.30-15.30h) Dr. Thomas Winters These  days  we are surrounded by creative text and image generators like GPT  and diffusion models that seem to be able to generate anything we want.  But how do we ensure that these types of AI truly aid us in overcoming  our unique challenges? This talk sheds light on several techniques for  controlling such generative models. We look at several powerful prompt  engineering techniques – the art of enhancing our communication with AI –  and useful ways of connecting these generators to other systems. We  dive into the world of autoregressive text generators  learn their inner  mechanisms and which training phases they went through to get to the  current state-of-the-art text generators. These insights help us  understand why certain prompt engineering techniques (such as few-shot  prompting  role-prompting and chain-of-thought prompting) are able to  outperform simpler prompting methods. We also briefly look at several  other techniques to overcome the limitations of such models  such as  retrieval-augmented generation and function calling. Similarly  we  uncover the workings of diffusion models and show several techniques to  gain more control over the generated images. We show how even some of  AI's classic hard problems  such as humour generation  become even more  within reach thanks to these large language models and their prompt  engineering techniques. Knowledge Graphs (17 April 2024  16.00-19.00h) Prof. Pieter Bonte and prof.

Lara Luys One  of the main challenges for industry today is to get machine learning  models out of the proof-of-concept phase and into production. This is  not an easy task since data in production is not static  due to which  the model performance can degrade over time. Machine learning operations  or MLOps is a paradigm that aims to address this problem. Being a  contraction of Machine Learning and DevOps  MLOps focuses on developing  and maintaining machine learning models in production. This includes  training  evaluating as well as monitoring the model. In this seminar   the MLOps pipeline and the underlying principles will be explained   illustrated by means of a number of tools that can be used in the MLOps  process. AI@Edge (25 April 2024  16.00-19.00h) Prof. Hans Hallez and drs. Gregory De Ruyter Edge  Computing has been proven to be an optimised way to delegate  computation from the cloud towards the devices where the sensing takes  place. Edge computing on embedded devices mostly limits itself towards  compression  filtering or other basic analysis. Recent trends also show  that devices near the edge of the sensor network are capable of machine  learning algorithms. In this session  we will explore different  techniques to bring machine learning towards the edge network and deploy  these algorithms. First  we will give an overview of what embedded  devices are  and how we can perform machine learning at these devices  both in inference and in training. Second  we will give a hands-on  demonstration as an inspiration of how machine learning at the edge can  be implemented. |Current Trends in AI  Advanced GenAI 17 April 2024  12301530h Dr Thomas

In today's world  organisations in  every sector must be aware of the ethical implications of their actions  in the digital realm. From the handling of personal data to the  development of new technologies  the decisions we make have the  potential to impact individuals  society  and the environment in  profound ways. By participating in this course  you will gain the  knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the complex ethical landscape  of the digital world and make informed decisions that align with your  organisation's values. Our course will cover a range of important topics  including ethics  frameworks and tools  regulation and legal issues  developing ethical  technology  technology assessment  ethical dilemmas  and ethics in data  and visualisation. This course is designed for professionals working in a wide range of organisations and industries. Whether you are employed in government  industry  academia  or the non-profit sector  you will benefit from the comprehensive coverage of key topics in Digital Ethics. The course is particularly relevant for those working in fields such as technology  interaction design  data analysis  policymaking  law  and research. However  anyone with an interest in Digital Ethics and the impact of technology on society will find value in this course. Session 1: Ethics frameworks – Thursday 18 April 2024  During this session  we will explore the various frameworks that can be  used to justify ethical decisions  including virtue ethics  consequence  ethics  and duty ethics. The participants will learn how to 'think  ethically'  and how these basic ethics frameworks can be applied to  various scenarios in which digital technologies play a central role. We  will also explore the concept of responsibility  including the different  types of responsibility (moral  legal  causal or role responsibility)  that can arise in the digital realm and discuss the responsibility gap.  This session will provide attendees with a solid foundation in the basic  principles of ethics and their relation to digital technology. Session 2: Building Ethical Foundations - Thursday 25 April 2024  This session aims to create a communal learning environment among the  participants  both online and on-site. During this session  participants  will introduce themselves  share their professional backgrounds and  discuss their expectations for the course  providing invaluable insight  for the instructors to tailor the subsequent sessions. Additionally   participants will reflect on the ethical aspects of their jobs   exploring potential ethical dilemmas within their specific work contexts  such as government  industry  academia  or non-profit sectors. This  early engagement is designed to foster a deeper understanding and  awareness of the ethical issues to be explored throughout the course   setting the stage for a more insightful reflection during the closing  session. Session 3: Tools and methods for ethical decision making - Thursday 2 May 2024  In this session we will introduce tools and methods that can be used to  make ethical decisions in different contexts  such as in industry   government  academia and research. Participants will learn about  practical frameworks and tools such as the guidance ethics approach  the  AI Blindspots and the Data Ethics Decision Aid. This session will  provide attendees with the basic tools and methods in the practice of  ethical decision-making in the digital realm. Session 4: Technology assessment in practice – Thursday 16 May 2024  This session will provide insight into the impact and effects of  technology  and will introduce tools and methods for assessing the risks  of innovation and averting undesirable consequences of new  technologies. The session will look into the challenges of achieving  (positive or negative) impacts with technology due to the interplay of  technology  society  organisations and individuals. A dedicated focus  will be on the impact of AI technologies in a government context as well  as on evaluating the results of social corporate responsibility actions  in the context of a company. This session will provide attendees with  practical examples of how to effectively assess the risks and potential  consequences of technology. Session 5: Designing ethical technology – Thursday 23 May 2024  In this session  we will explore different approaches to designing  technology that takes into account the needs and values of human beings.  We will explore humanity-centered design (including design thinking)   inclusive design  value-centered design  and participatory design (or  co-creation). We will then discuss how technologies are often designed  in a way that threatens our digital well-being  and which strategies can  be used to improve digital well-being. This session will provide  attendees with the tools and knowledge they need to create ethical  technology that is designed with people at its core. Session 6: Ethical topics and dilemmas – Thursday 30 May 2024 This session will explore the application of behaviorist principles in  digital technologies  particularly in the realm of surveillance. It will  highlight how these technologies not only observe but actively  influence and modify user behavior  raising important ethical questions  about privacy  autonomy  and the power dynamics between users and  technology providers. The session will emphasize the need for ethical  guidelines to address the challenges posed by digital surveillance. This  session further examines the various functions fairness and equality  hold in the AI governance debate. Drawing from political philosophical  theories of justice and practical use-cases  a relational perspective on  AI is developed to understand better the social and technical dynamics  that give rise to digital injustice. This session will provide attendees  with an understanding of the ethical challenges that can arise in the  digital world  and the tools and frameworks that can be used to address  them. Session 7: Legal and policy issues – Thursday 6 June 2024  This session will explore a number of legal issues that arise in the  digital realm. This session will first provide attendees with an  understanding of appropriate legal frameworks related to the free flow  of information  (personal) data protection  and the principles  rights  and obligations of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  This session will also provide a comprehensive review of the impact AI  may have on individual and collective human rights across various  sectors. The participants will learn about the technical legal  instruments at their disposal to combat AI discrimination  including  legal tools related to direct and indirect discrimination  as well as  discrimination by association. Moreover  participants will be invited to  critically reflect on the resilience of ethics in the context of AI.  This approach to AI will consider high-level legal instruments within  the European Union  such as the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights  the  proposed AI Act  and the set of equality directives. A comparative law  approach will also be mobilized to provide a better understanding of  addressing AI challenges with traditional legal instruments. Session 8: Ethics in data and visualisation – Thursday 13 June 2024  In this session  we will discuss the ethical aspects of handling and  visualising of data. We will start by examining how data are  'constructed' and therefore are inherently 'biased'  rather than  representing an objective truth. We cross over to understand the value  of visualising data  acknowledging its potential risk to yet further  objectify this constructed  situated nature of data. We then dive into  how some data visualisations can be (unintentionally) perceived as  unethical  whether through potentially misleading design choices  the  use of dubious data  the omission of uncertainties  or the disregard of  cognitive biases. This session aims to provide practical skills and  reflective insights for handling and visualising data in ways that are  more transparent  equitable and responsible. Session 9: Closing and reflection – Thursday 20 June 2024 The seventh and final session will be a closing session focused on  reflection. In this session  participants will have the opportunity to  reflect on how the topics covered in the previous sessions apply to  their own professional situations. This session will provide a space for  attendees to share their thoughts  insights  and experiences  and to  discuss how they plan to incorporate the knowledge and skills they have  gained into their work. This will be a valuable opportunity for  participants to consolidate their learning and to develop a personal  plan for applying the principles of Digital Ethics in their professional  lives. |Digital

frameworks related to the free flow  of information  personal data protection  and the principles  rights  and obligations of the EUs General Data Protection Regulation GDPR  This session will also provide a comprehensive review of the impact AI  may have on individual and collective human rights across various  sectors The participants will learn about the technical legal  instruments at their disposal to combat AI discrimination  including  legal tools related to direct and indirect discrimination  as well as  discrimination by association Moreover  participants will be invited to  critically reflect on the resilience of ethics in the context of AI  This approach to AI will consider highlevel legal instruments within  the European Union  such as the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights  the  proposed AI Act  and the set of equality directives A comparative law  approach will also be mobilized to provide a better understanding of  addressing AI challenges with traditional legal instruments Session 8 Ethics in data and visualisation – Thursday 13 June 2024  In this session  we will discuss the ethical aspects of handling and  visualising of data We will start by examining how data are  constructed and therefore are inherently biased  rather than  representing an objective truth We cross over to understand the value  of visualising data  acknowledging its potential risk to yet further  objectify this constructed  situated nature of data We then dive into  how some data visualisations can be unintentionally perceived as  unethical  whether through potentially misleading design choices  the  use of dubious data  the omission of uncertainties  or the disregard of  cognitive biases This session aims to provide practical skills and  reflective insights for handling and visualising data in ways that are  more transparent  equitable and responsible Session 9 Closing and reflection – Thursday 20 June 2024 The seventh and final session will be a closing session focused on  reflection In this session  participants will have the opportunity to  reflect on how the topics covered in the previous sessions apply to  their own professional situations This session will provide a space for  attendees to share their thoughts  insights  and experiences  and to  discuss how they plan to incorporate the knowledge and skills they have  gained into their work This will be a valuable opportunity for  participants to consolidate their learning and to develop a personal  plan for applying the principles of Digital Ethics in their professional  lives  More info  Share this course   httpswwwkuleuvenbedigisoceducationandtraininghybridcourseondigitalethics 18 Apr 2024  20 Jun 2024 coursehybridKU Leuven|['Digital Ethics', 'personal data',

The term 'data space' has gained a lot of traction lately, specifically with the upcoming 'European Health Data Space' legislation. The definition of data space is still under discussion. However, we and others (e.g. NCP Flanders) describe it as ""a  decentralized infrastructure for trustworthy data sharing and exchange  in data ecosystems, based on commonly agreed principles."""|" In recent years  a series of health data spaces have arised. However   at the moment  the strategic oversight is lost and many questions  remain. For example: Which data space initiatives are out there?How do they relate to each other?How will they work together/in synergy to maximize the impact?How will this affect the local data management at the level of the individual data partners? With this symposium  we aspire to facilitate an in-depth exploration of data spaces and research infrastructures  elucidate challenges and best practices for large-scale projects  and engage in a panel debate on the feasibility of implementing and integrating various data spaces at different levels  all underpinning the advancement of healthcare data sharing and research. The  event plans to highlight different Belgian data spaces and to delve  into profound discussions during panel debates  exploring complex topics  like challenges and future perspectives in health data sharing and analysis. As i~HD will co-moderate the event  the bridge towards Europe is guaranteed. Target Audience: The symposium is tailored for health data enthusiasts  from Belgium and neighboring countries. While expecting diverse  attendees  both beginners and experts  we are aiming for accessibility  without compromising depth. In our sessions  we explore a wide array of dimensions  ranging from  geographical nuances to various data types and the complexities of  transmural care. We delve into the intricacies of first-line care   hospital settings  and innovative mobile healthcare (mHealth).  Furthermore  our exploration extends to discovering the transformative  potential inherent in different data types  encompassing everything from  imaging to -omics and harmonized clinical data. #JoinTheJourney  All speakers are asked to touch upon the following questions in preparation of their talk: What are their “why” and expected clinical impact?Which socio-technical challenges are they trying to address?What are their main achievements so far?What excites them for the future?10:00-10:10 | Meeting Start (Welcome) Liesbet M.

In this programme, we will explore the full spectrum of cybersecurity, from prevention to response, while gaining both immediate, hands-on skills and a foresight for the future of cybersecurity. This programme brings together academic researchers and industrial experts, and thus provides a blend of lectures and use cases and practical testimonials.|" Many companies rely on a Security Information and Event Management system (SIEM) to consolidate data from various applications and equipment  allowing them to maintain an overview of their security landscape. To investigate alerts generated by their SIEM system more thoroughly  they turn to a Network Protocol Analyzer (NPA). An NPA captures  analyzes  and visualizes network traffic and can have a broad range of applications.However  the procedures and configurations of NPAs vary according to the specific issue at hand (cybersecurity  troubleshooting  etc.)  which often leads to incorrect or inefficient usage in practice. During this workshop  we will build the knowledge and skills necessary to use Network Protocol Analyzers correctly and efficiently  particularly in the context of cybersecurity threats. We will work with real-life scenarios and gain practical insights into the underlying workings of NPAs. The NPA that we will delve deeper into during the workshop is the open-source NPA  Wireshark.

It spans a wide range of multivariate methods including path analysis  mediation analysis  confirmatory factor analysis  growth curve modeling  and many more. Many applications of SEM can be found in the social  economic  behavioral and health sciences  but the technology is increasingly used in disciplines like biology  neuroscience and operation research. SEM is often used to test theories or hypotheses that can be represented by a path diagram. In a path diagram  observed variables are depicted by boxes  while latent variables (hypothetical constructs measured by multiple indicators) are depicted by circles. Hypothesized (possibly causal) effects among these variables are represented by single-headed arrows. If you had ever found yourself drawing a path diagram in order to get a better overview of the complex interrelations among some key variables in your data  this course is for you. The first day of the course provides an introduction to the theory and application of structural equation modeling  and illustrates how to use the open-source R package `lavaan’ (see https://lavaan.org) to conduct an SEM analysis. On the second day  we discuss several special topics that are often needed by applied users (handling missing data  nonnormal data  categorical data  longitudinal data  multilevel data  etc.). With the exception of a short practical session at the end of the first day  the two days are mostly lectures  to maximize the amount of information that we can teach. However  do-it-yourself practicals (with written feedback and solutions) will be made available and illustrate all the topics that are covered in this course. Target audience This course targets everyone with an interest in testing theories or models that involve relationships between both observed and latent variables. The audience for this course can include both novices with little or no previous experience with SEM  as well as existing users who wish to refresh or update their theoretical and practical understanding of structural equation modeling. Fees The participation fee is 750 EUR for participants from the private sector. Reduced prices apply to students and staff from non-profit  social profit  and government organizations. An exam fee of 35 EUR will be applied.

You will be able to build basic applications using IDP, and you will be able to identify potential use cases for this technology.|" In their day-to-day operations  companies typically make many small but important decisions  such as:  which employee should handle an incoming requestwhich service should be recommended to a specific customerhow should a specific product be configured to meet a customer's requirement whether a specific customer is entitled to a discount  etc.  Decision  support systems can help employees make these decisions faster  more  reliably and more consistently  reducing costs and increasing confidence  in the process. To develop such systems  black-box AI methods (such as  deep learning) are not well-suited  because they lack the required  transparency and explainability. A more promising approach are  knowledge-based AI systems  which derive their 'intelligence' not from  data  but from logical models of rules  regulations and expert  knowledge. In this workshop  you will get to know the  state-of-the-art IDP knowledge-base system  developed at KU Leuven. It  is currently being used by companies in the manufacturing (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpPe0GRjifE)  financial (https://youtu.be/Zzsy4MtdWBE)  and legal sectors to provide various decision support  both to their  customers and in-house. This system is based on methods and techniques  that were developed for declarative programming systems such as Prolog   but it offers a number of important innovations: (1) instead of focusing  only on querying  the IDP system provides a wide range of different  functionalities that can be used to implement rich interactive  interfaces that support users in different work-flows  (2) instead of  relying on programmers  the system allows its end users to maintain the  underlying knowledge base  which means that we can cut out the ""middle  man"" of IT staff and allow the business experts themselves to update the  system  thereby not only reducing cost and turn-around time but also  putting the ownership of the decision knowledge in the right hands. The  workshop starts with a brief introduction to Knowledge-based AI and  presents existing applications in the financial and manufacturing  sectors. We then proceed with a hands-on tutorial  using a freely  available web interface that participants access from their own laptops. "|A NoCode Approach to Decision Support and Knowledge Capturing  In their daytoday operations  companies typically make many small but important decisions  such as  which employee should handle an incoming requestwhich service should be recommended to a specific customerhow should a specific product be configured to meet a customers requirement whether a specific customer is entitled to a discount  etc  Decision  support systems can help employees make these decisions faster  more  reliably and more consistently  reducing costs and increasing confidence  in the process To develop such systems  blackbox AI methods such as  deep learning are not wellsuited  because they lack the required  transparency and explainability A more promising approach are  knowledgebased AI systems  which derive their intelligence not from  data  but from logical models of rules  regulations and expert  knowledge In this workshop  you will get to know the  stateoftheart IDP knowledgebase system  developed at KU Leuven It  is currently being used by companies in the manufacturing httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkpPe0GRjifE  financial httpsyoutubeZzsy4MtdWBE  and legal sectors to provide various decision support  both to their  customers and inhouse This system is based on methods and techniques  that were developed for declarative programming systems such as Prolog   but it offers a number of important innovations 1 instead of focusing  only on querying  the IDP system provides a wide range of different  functionalities that can be used to implement rich interactive  interfaces that support users in different workflows  2 instead of  relying on programmers  the system allows its end users to maintain the  underlying knowledge base  which means that we can cut out the middle  man of IT staff and allow the business experts themselves to update the  system  thereby not only reducing cost and turnaround time but also  putting the ownership of the decision knowledge in the right hands The  workshop starts with a brief introduction to Knowledgebased AI and  presents existing applications in the financial and manufacturing  sectors We then proceed with a handson tutorial  using a freely  available web interface that participants access from their own laptops  In this workshop you will get to know the stateoftheart IDP  knowledgebase system that has been developed at KU Leuven and is  currently used by companies in various sectors You will be able to build basic applications using IDP and you will be able to identify potential use cases for this technology httpspuckuleuvenbenlopleiding6kjpeqerb3gbx7zo Workshop workshopBruggeKU Leuven Postuniversitair Centrum VAIA|['Decision Support', 'Knowledge Capturing', 'customers requirement', 'deep learning', 'declarative programming']

As these technologies have a growing impact on all domains of our lives, it becomes increasingly important to map, understand and assess the challenges and opportunities they raise. The programme's goal is to offer participants the latest insights on AI from various perspectives, and in particular the fields of law, ethics and policy.| In 2021  KU Leuven organised the first edition of the Summer School  on the Law  Ethics and Policy of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Given the  programme's overwhelming success  three editions have taken place thus  far. The fourth edition will take place from 1 to 10 July 2024. The Summer School aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the  various legal  ethical and policy-related issues around AI and  algorithm-driven processes more broadly. As these technologies have a  growing impact on all domains of our lives  it becomes increasingly  important to map  understand and assess the challenges and opportunities  they raise. This requires an interdisciplinary approach  which is why  we are collaborating across faculties and departments to organise this  Summer School. The programme's goal is to offer participants the latest  insights on AI from various perspectives  and in particular the fields  of law  ethics and policy.  The lectures are provided by renowned academics  policy-makers from  EU and international institutions as well as practitioners  allowing  participants to grasp not only the theoretical but also the practical  implications of the use of AI in these fields.  The Summer School's intended audience concerns postgraduate students  who already obtained a master's degree and junior/senior researchers  from various disciplines  as well as policy analysts  lawyers and legal  experts  civil servants  members of civil society organisations  AI  practitioners  and other professionals with an interest in broadening  their understanding of AI and its impact on society.  Participants receive a certificate of attendance with the equivalence  of 3 ECTS credits. Those interested also have an opportunity to share  their research with fellow participants through a research presentation  session.  Thus far  the Summer School has taken place as a hybrid event  enabling participants to join both on campus and online.  Whether physically or virtually  we look forward to welcoming you to Leuven! Course overview The Summer School covers a range of topics that will enable  participants to better grasp the various legal  ethical and policy  implications of the development and use of AI in society. All lectures  are taught in English. The schedule of the Summer School's 2023 edition can be found here. Most lectures focus on horizontal domains of interest  covering topics such as:  Philosophy of AI Ethics of AI AI and Data Protection Law AI and Competition Law AI and Intellectual Property Law AI and Consumer Protection AI and Liability Law AI and Labour Law AI and Fairnes The European Commission's proposals for an AI Regulation  the Digital Services Act & the Digital Markets Act AI governance and the role of European & International institutions  Though Artificial Intelligence is a general purpose technology  many  of its legal  ethical and policy-related implications are context- or  sector-specific. Therefore  the programme also explores several vertical  domains. These cover inter alia:  AI and Law Enforcement AI and Public Services AI and Warfare AI and Healthcare AI and Education AI and Legal Tech  At the end of the course  participants who attended 90% of the  classes and passed the exam receive a certificate of attendance with an  equivalence of 3 ECTS credits. Those interested will also have the  possibility to present their own research during a research presentation  session.  Intended Audience The Summer School’s intended audience concerns postgraduate students  who already obtained a master's degree and PhD researchers from various  disciplines  as well as more senior researchers  policy analysts   lawyers and legal experts  civil servants  members of civil society  organisations  AI practitioners  and other professionals with an  interest in broadening their understanding of AI and its impact on  society.

The  programme has been designed with a specific need in the job market in  mind: many current employees in for example R&D divisions of leading  companies are highly skilled but did not receive specific training on  AI in their formal education. Perhaps you  too  experience the need to  bring your AI skills up to date and are looking for a qualitative AI  course to do that. This postgraduate training allows professionals to  acquire in one year a solid academic knowledge of artificial  intelligence  as well as insight into the domains of image and language  (computer vision/NLP) and business aspects of AI.  The postgraduate programme Artificial Intelligence in Business and Industry stands  firmly on its own but also opens the door to more. Participants can  choose to follow a follow-up track into the Advanced Master AI in Business and Industry (to  be launched in September 2023)  where they gain access to the wider  range of in-depth  broadening and  in particular  more applied modules.  The courses offered in the postgraduate programme form an integral part  of the Advanced Master Artificial Intelligence in Business and Industry   and participants who pass the courses in the postgraduate programme  will be granted exemptions when following the rest of the master’s  programme. The programme aims at different  kinds of engineers (e.g. in Engineering Science  Engineering Technology   or Business Engineers who majored in data science or applied computer  science). In addition  the programme is open to masters in mathematics  and physics. In general  any participant with a master’s degree that  offers sufficient background in mathematics  programming and technology  will be admitted. If you do not have one of the aforementioned master  diplomas  you can submit a file with your motivation and CV to the  programme committee  who will assess your application. Note that Python  proficiency (basic) is required. An optional 6-month subscription to  Datacamp can be provided upon registration.  While recently  graduated students are welcome  the programme also offers added value to  professionals with field experience  wishing to re- or upskill  themselves in the field of Artificial Intelligence in order to make the  most of their career opportunities. The programme specifically caters to  participants looking for a theoretical  academically grounded approach  to AI. Given the advanced content of the courses  the profiles most  suitable for this postgraduate are  for example  IT developers and  functional analysts or R&D staff  engineers  project leaders and  managers. The programme starts with the theoretical AI foundations that are indispensable for professionals. Participants therefore get 3 academic courses that teach them the scientific basics of artificial intelligence. In addition  the door is opened to industrial applications and general business applications with the courses in the second semester. Fundamentals of AI In this course  you will acquire a deep knowledge and insight into foundational techniques from Artificial Intelligence  including search methods and their applications to games  the version spaces algorithm for machine learning  constraint processing techniques  strips planning and theorem proving for first-order predicate logic. You will be able to simulate each of the above techniques with pen and paper on small new examples and have insight into the relevance of these techniques for applications in domains such as manufacturing  health  education  logistics  manufacturing  and robotics.  Machine Learning and Inductive Inference This  course will familiarize you with the domain of machine learning  which  concerns techniques to build software that can learn how to perform a  certain task (or improve its performance on it) by studying examples of  how it has been accomplished previously  and in a broader sense the  discovery of knowledge from observations (inductive inference).After following this course  you will have a basic understanding of the general principles of learninghave an overview of the existing techniques for machine learning and data miningunderstand how these techniques work  and why they workbe able to implement programs that learn or exhibit adaptive behavior  using these techniquesbe up-to-date with the current state of the art in machine learning researchbe able to contribute to contemporary machine learning research  Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning The  course aims to introduce the basic techniques  methods and properties  of ANN and to study their application to selected problems. The basic  concepts will be introduced in the lectures. Advanced topics and recent  research results will be touched upon occasionally. You will study and  develop explicit neural network models for selected applications. Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing The  course introduces natural language processing technologies and their  applications in a variety of tasks  which include text mining  machine  translation  question answering and dialogue modelling. It also  introduces computer vision algorithms and their applications such as  image classification  object detection  and image segmentation. Special  attention goes to applications that require the joint processing of  language and visual data  as this is a natural way to interact with  machines.  The students will gain insights into suitable machine  learning algorithms that ideally are trained with limited annotated  examples or human feedback. They will learn how to build and critically  assess an application making use of the most recent techniques and  resources.  Business Analytics In this course  you will  learn to understand how business problems can be formulated with  advanced analytics techniques as a potential solution. You will be able  to reason on the organizational and managerial aspects of applying big  data and analytics techniques and understand how prescriptive analytics  and causal ML can help to use analytics for business decision-making.  The course teaches you how analytical modelling techniques can be  optimized and evaluated from a profit-driven perspective and how  analytics techniques can exploit network-based information.  After  following “Business Analytics”  you will know how to deal with  unstructured data in the form of textual inputs  and how to use such  data for practical business applications such as sentiment analysis or  social media analytics. The course deals with how state-of-the-art  explainability techniques can give insights into black-box machine  learning models and how process mining techniques can be applied to data  sets originating from process-aware information systems  including  automated process discovery  conformance checking and extension. Upon  completion of the course  you know which data science tools and  environments are important for realizing applications of machine  learning in business  including platforms such as Hadoop  Spark  etc   which business applications might benefit from deep learning techniques   and how to apply them and evaluate their appropriateness. |AI in Business and Industry  The Postgraduate Certificate

In this programme, we will explore the full spectrum of cybersecurity, from prevention to response, while gaining both immediate, hands-on skills and a foresight for the future of cybersecurity. This programme brings together academic researchers and industrial experts, and thus provides a blend of lectures and use cases and practical testimonials.|" In this session  we provide a comprehensive guide on  effectively responding to cyber-attacks within the bounds of the law.  The presentation explores the intricate web of legal considerations that  accompany cyber incidents  delving into the realms of criminal law   data protection  privacy laws  and regulatory compliance together with  all other possible side effects.  We begin by dissecting the  anatomy of a cyber-attack through an incident response plan. A  significant portion of the lecture is dedicated to the legal framework  surrounding cyber-attacks. This includes an examination of data breach  notification requirements  both domestically and internationally  as  well as an exploration of the evolving landscape of cyber-related  legislation. The discussion extends to the legal obligations imposed on  organisations  shedding light on potential liabilities and consequences  for non-compliance.  Furthermore  the lecture addresses  upon  experiences learned  the critical role of digital forensics in incident  response and legal proceedings. We gain an understanding of best  practices for preserving electronic evidence  ensuring its admissibility  in court  and collaborating with law enforcement agencies. The lecture  also focuses on the post-incident phase  elucidating the legal aspects  of breach disclosure  communication strategies  and managing  reputational fallout. Practical guidance on engaging with regulatory  bodies  law enforcement  and legal counsel is provided  offering a  roadmap for a coordinated and lawful response to cyber incidents.  To  conclude  we get a firsthand account from a company (TVH) that has  experienced a cyberattack and that has been through the challenges of  post-attack damage control.
