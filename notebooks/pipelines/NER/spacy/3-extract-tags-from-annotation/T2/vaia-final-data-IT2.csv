VAT|https://www.fari.brussels/education/enabling-the-future-of-work|22 Mar 2024 09:30 - 16:30|More info  Share this course  | This course will be given by Prof. Rob Heyman on Friday 22 March 2024 from 9.30 to 16:30 CET at the FARI Test & Experience Center (Cantersteen 16  1000  Brussels). The problems or challenges we wish to address in this 1-day course are: Adopt AI or die: there is a push to use a form of artificial  intelligence for each organization  and failure to do so seems to imply  the end of your organization's history. But how do you ensure that your  investments in AI are sustainable and successfully adopted by your  colleagues and employees? While you are adapting to this new technological context  you will also have to deal with new regulations. How will you do this? Lastly  adopting technological and legal change is not something you  do on your own  so what are methods to facilitate this change in your  organization? While not absolutely necessary  it helps to have a clear challenge in  mind when joining this session. Rob will invite you to work on your  innovation case or with someone in case you lack one. Knowledge of legal frameworks or AI is not necessary. Session 1: How to and how not to Introduce Automation on the Work Floor We will look at practical  theoretical concepts to understand  innovation on the work floor and the tension between users and  technology. The aim is to understand all successful technology  adoptions as innovations that change users' daily practices. Next  we discuss cases where AI or industry 4.0 applications were  introduced and what these meant for different stakeholders. If you have a  case  you wish to discuss  be sure to contact Rob Heyman to discuss  this as part of the session. Session 2: Boosting Operational Efficiency by Reducing Digital Friction and Increasing Agility If you believe innovation can only be successful if practices change  then it follows that regulations can only be successful if regulations change practices  too. In this part we look at the particular challenges we experienced during the implementation of the GDPR and what this might mean for the implementation of the AI Act. Session 3: Improving Information Protection and Governance During the last part of the day  we will use a case for innovation of your choosing and define a workshop or process to include colleagues and employees in this process. In this interactive part  you will learn a few facilitation methods and the key ingredients to define co-creation projects on your work floor. This training was designed for decision  makers from public organizations that want to fully empower workforces  with flexible digital workplaces  increased agility and stronger  information protection to address current business needs and evolving  challenges.

This is because the physician-patient relationship contains inherent inequalities of knowledge  skills  and control of resources  and it treats matters both intimate and potentially of great importance to the patient (Rhodes 2001; Nickel & Frank 2020). These responsibilities include physician's obligation to earn trust and be trustworthy (Rhodes 2001; 2020). The field of psychiatric medicine faces additional ethical challenges specifically related to patient trust. As artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies (in diagnosis  relapse prevention  and treatment) begin to play a larger role in all medicine  and specifically psychiatry  these ethical challenges may be exacerbated or complicated. In this talk I present three of these challenges relating to patient testimony  false empowerment  and harm prevention. |Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Psychiatric Medicine Trustworthiness Epistemic Justice and Empowerment  Medicine has a distinct set of moral responsibilities This is because the physicianpatient relationship contains inherent inequalities of knowledge  skills  and control of resources  and it treats matters both intimate and potentially of great importance to the patient Rhodes 2001 Nickel  Frank 2020 These responsibilities include physician's obligation to earn trust and be trustworthy Rhodes 2001 2020 The field of psychiatric medicine faces additional ethical challenges specifically related to patient trust As artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies in diagnosis  relapse prevention  and treatment begin to play a larger role in all medicine  and specifically psychiatry  these ethical challenges may be exacerbated or complicated In this talk I present three of these challenges relating to patient testimony  false empowerment  and harm prevention  More info  Share this course   httpsghumkuleuvenbeLCHHcalendarlectureseriesmachinelearningandartificialintelligenceinpsychiatricmedicinebylilyfrank 7 Mar 2024 1600  1730 lezingonline amp LeuvenLeuven Centre for Health Humanities LCH² KU Leuven|['Machine Learning', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'artificial intelligence', 'machine learning']

Inaugural lecture of the Kulak Francqui Chair 2024 by Prof. Dr. Marco Zorzi Deep learning in artificial neural networks is the driving force behind the contemporary revolution brought by AI technologies. Deep neural networks  show impressive performance in a wide range of domains  from image  processing to natural language understanding. What insights can we  derive from these “artificial brains” about the human mind and brain?  Conversely  can we use behavioural and neuroscientific methods to test and challenge these AI systems? In this talk  Professor Marco Zorzi will discuss interdisciplinary research that emphasizes a constant dialogue between cognitive (neuro)science and AI. Contrasting  humans and machines in terms of learning and performance  including  failures  is the key to deepen our understanding of human cognition and  to highlight necessary improvements in AI technologies. 18.30 | Welcome 19:00 | Opening of the ceremony  Welcome by Professor Piet Desmet  vice rector KU Leuven Kulak Introduction by Professor Bert Reynvoet  promotor  Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences KU Leuven Kulak 19:15 | Inaugural lecture by Professor Marco Zorzi  Minds and Machines: A Dialogue Between Cognitive Science and AI 20:25 | Closing remarks by Professor Fien Depaepe  Dean of the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences KU Leuven Kulak 20:30 | Reception The inaugural lecture will be preceded and followed by a series of lectures at KU Leuven Kulak and Leuven by Prof. Marco Zorzi.

The fact that many practical problems deal with continuous outcomes (e.g. income  blood pressure  temperature  affect) makes linear regression a popular tool  and most of us will be familiar with the concept of drawing a line through a cloud of data points. The first two sessions of this module introduce the conceptual framework of this method using the simple case of a single predictor. Formulas and technicalities are kept to a minimum and the main focus is on interpretation of results and assessing model validity. This includes confidence statements on the predictor effect (hypothesis tests and confidence intervals)  using the regression model to predict future results and verification of model assumptions. In session 3 and 4 we allow for more than one predictor leading to the multiple linear regression model. We focus on either explanation or prediction. How to come to a parsimonious model starting from a large number of predictors will be discussed in detail. In these complex linear models special attention will be given to interpreting individual predictor effects  as they critically depend on other terms in the model and underlying relations between predictors (confounding). In the last session a more elaborate data analysis is discussed. We touch on problems where linear regression is not appropriate and replaced by related approaches such as generalized linear models and mixed models. Different features will be illustrated with case examples from the instructors practical experience  and participants are encouraged to bring examples from their own work. Hands-on exercises are worked out behind the PC using the R software. Target audience This course targets professionals and investigators from all areas who are involved in prediction problems or need to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more explanatory variables.

We start with an overview of methodologies and technologies   beginning with a holistic view of cybersecurity in a digital ecosystem  (session 1). Cybersecurity plays a critical role in ensuring data privacy   which involves complying with privacy laws and regulations like GDPR  (session 2). The programme then progresses to hands-on workshops: one  focused on network security (session 3) and another on the protection of  the growing category of embedded ‘IoT' devices (session 4). As standards and certifications also  play an increasing role in implementing cybersecurity measures  this is  the focus of the next session (session 5). We learn how (not) to respond  when a cyberattack occurs  and hear the lessons learned from a 'victim' (Session 6). Finally  we look ahead to what the future holds  especially in the context of cybersecurity in the era of quantum computing (Session 7).

However  describing these decisions in a standardized format such as DMN is a time-consuming task  as various textual sources need to be analyzed. In this talk  we present the results of our experiments on an automated approach to generating decision tables from natural language based on the GPT-3 LLM. Through a total of 72 experiments over six problem descriptions  we evaluated GPT-3's decision logic modeling and reasoning capabilities. While GPT-3 demonstrates promising abilities in extracting decision context and identifying relevant variables from natural language  further enhancements are needed to improve its decision table capabilities for efficient automation of DMN modeling. by Ioannis Dasoulas An abundance of tabular data exists and is used by a wide range of applications. However  a big portion of these data lack the semantic information necessary for users and machines to properly understand them. This lack of table semantic understanding impedes their usage in data analytics pipelines. Existing solutions are focused on specific annotation tasks and types of tables  and rely solely on large knowledge bases  making it difficult to re-use in real-world settings. In this talk  we present TorchicTab  aversatile semantic table interpretation system able to annotate tables with varied structures by using either an external knowledge graph  such as Wikidata  or annotated tables with pre-defined terms for training. The results demonstrate TorchicTab's ability to produce accurate annotations for different tasks across varied datasets. |KG3D Learning and Reasoning Webinar  by Simon Vandevelde Operational decisions are an important part of knowledgeintensive organizations  as these are taken in a high volume on a daily basis However  describing these decisions in a standardized format such as DMN is a timeconsuming task  as various textual sources need to be analyzed In this talk  we present the results of our experiments on an automated approach to generating decision tables from natural language based on the GPT3 LLM Through a total of 72 experiments over six problem descriptions  we evaluated GPT3's decision logic modeling and reasoning capabilities While GPT3 demonstrates promising abilities in extracting decision context and identifying relevant variables from natural language  further enhancements are needed to improve its decision table capabilities for efficient automation of DMN modeling by Ioannis Dasoulas An abundance of tabular data exists and is used by a wide range of applications However  a big portion of these data lack the semantic information necessary for users and machines to properly understand them This lack of table semantic understanding impedes their usage in data analytics pipelines Existing solutions are focused on specific annotation tasks and types of tables  and rely solely on large knowledge bases  making it difficult to reuse in realworld settings In this talk  we present TorchicTab  aversatile semantic table interpretation system able to annotate tables with varied structures by using either an external knowledge graph  such as Wikidata  or annotated tables with predefined terms for training The results demonstrate TorchicTab's ability to produce accurate annotations for different tasks across varied datasets  More info  Share this course   httpskg3dcskuleuvenbeevents 26 Feb 2024 0900  1015 webinaronlineKG3D KU Leuven|['GPT3', 'LLM', 'modeling', 'GPT3', 'extracting', 'automation', 'modeling', 'tabular', 'data analytics', 'pipelines', 'annotation tasks', 'TorchicTab', 'knowledge graph', 'annotated tables', 'accurate', 'datasets']

Its special case is the problem of finding real solutions of a system of polynomial equations. This difficult problem has many applications in fields such as statistics, signal processing, machine learning, computer vision, computational geometry, and control engineering. The Moment-SOS hierarchy is an approach to polynomial optimization that solves it globally at the price of solving a family of convex (semidefinite) optimization problems of increasing size.| The lecture introduces the approach and describes its main milestones during the last two decades. The focus is on the computational features of the Moment-SOS hierarchy  its limitations and current efforts to overcome them. |The MomentSOS hierarchy  The lecture introduces the approach and describes its main milestones during the last two decades The focus is on the computational features of the MomentSOS hierarchy  its limitations and current efforts to overcome them  Polynomial optimization consists of minimizing a polynomial of many real variables subject to polynomial equality and inequality constraints Its special case is the problem of finding real solutions of a system of polynomial equations This difficult problem has many applications in fields such as statistics signal processing machine learning computer vision computational geometry and control engineering The MomentSOS hierarchy is an approach to polynomial optimization that solves it globally at the price of solving a family of convex semidefinite optimization problems of increasing size httpshomesesatkuleuvenbesistawwwbdmbacktotherootsindexphpseminars Seminar by Didier Henrion LAASCNRS Toulouse France seminarHeverlee LeuvenKU Leuven ESAT STADIUS|['MomentSOS hierarchy', 'Polynomial optimization', 'polynomial equations', 'statistics', 'signal processing', 'machine learning', 'computer vision', 'computational geometry', 'control engineering', 'MomentSOS hierarchy', 'polynomial optimization', 'convex semidefinite optimization']

Multivariate statistical methods may be used  but for often the dimensionality of the data set is much larger than the number of (biological) samples. Modern advances in statistical data analyses allow for the appropriate analysis of such data. Methods for the analysis of high dimensional data rely heavily on multivariate statistical methods. Therefore a large part of the course content is devoted to multivariate methods  but with a focus on high dimensional settings and issues. Multivariate statistical analysis covers many methods. In this course a selection of techniques is covered based on our experience that they are frequently used in industry and research institutes. The course is taught using case studies with applications from different fields (analytical chemistry  ecology  biotechnology  genomics  …).

The roots are found by computing the eigenvalues of the associated companion matrix. A companion matrix is an upper Hessenberg matrix that is of unitary-plus-rank-one form, that is, it is the sum of a unitary matrix and a rank-one matrix. When running Francis's implicitly-shifted QR algorithm this property is preserved, and exactly that is exploited here.| To compactly store the matrix we will show that only 3n-1 rotators are required  so the storage space is O(n). In fact  these rotators only represent the unitary part  but we will show that we can retrieve the rank-one part from the unitary part with a trick. It is thus not necessary to store the rank-one part explicitly. Francis's algorithm tuned for working on this representation requires only O(n) flops per iteration and thus O(n²) flops in total. The algorithm is normwise backward stable and is shown to be about as accurate as the (slow) Francis QR algorithm applied to the companion matrix without exploiting the structure. It is also faster than other O(n²) methods that have been proposed  and its accuracy is comparable or better. The paper accompanying this research received SIAM's outstanding paper prize in 2017.https://www.siam.org/prizes-recognition/major-prizes-lectures/detail/siam-outstanding-paper-prizes |Fast and Stable Roots of Polynomials via Companion Matrices  To compactly store the matrix we will show that only 3n1 rotators are required  so the storage space is On In fact  these rotators only represent the unitary part  but we will show that we can retrieve the rankone part from the unitary part with a trick It is thus not necessary to store the rankone part explicitly Francis's algorithm tuned for working on this representation requires only On flops per iteration and thus On² flops in total The algorithm is normwise backward stable and is shown to be about as accurate as the slow Francis QR algorithm applied to the companion matrix without exploiting the structure It is also faster than other On² methods that have been proposed  and its accuracy is comparable or better The paper accompanying this research received SIAM's outstanding paper prize in 2017httpswwwsiamorgprizesrecognitionmajorprizeslecturesdetailsiamoutstandingpaperprizes  Raf Vandebril presents a fast and stable algorithm for computing roots of polynomials The roots are found by computing the eigenvalues of the associated companion matrix A companion matrix is an upper Hessenberg matrix that is of unitaryplusrankone form that is it is the sum of a unitary matrix and a rankone matrix When running Francis's implicitlyshifted QR algorithm this property is preserved and exactly that is exploited here httpshomesesatkuleuvenbesistawwwbdmbacktotherootsindexphpseminars Seminar by Raf Vandebril seminarHeverlee LeuvenKU Leuven ESAT STADIUS|['Francis QR algorithm', 'companion matrix', 'research', 'eigenvalues', 'Hessenberg matrix', 'unitary matrix', 'rankone matrix']

Data analysis helps sports entities evaluate the performance of their  athletes and assess the recruitment necessary to improve the team's  performance. It also evaluates the strong and weak areas of their  opponents, enabling coaches to make the right decision on their tactics.  But data is not only used in performance optimization. It is also used in the storytelling of the game and the safety monitoring of the athlete/venue.  The Becoming An Olympian In Sports Analytics (BOSA) Winter School, organized by the IDLab Sports Data Science teams of Ghent University and the University of Antwerp, focuses on each of these topics. It is a week-long intensive course bringing together junior and senior academics and practitioners in the field of sports data science. Two tracks will be organized in parallel  with sufficient cross-pollination: (i) a track focused on sports  scientists that want to gather more AI/data science skills, and (ii) a  more hands-on track for computer scientists to apply their  expertise/skills in a sports context. The Winter School is open to people coming from academia and professionals active within the sports sector.| During the first three days  BOSA participants will gain fundamental and practical skills from both disciplines (sport and data science) and combine/mix them in the final hackathon project in which they will intensively work together in a multidisciplinary context.  The hackathon will require participants to put together the diverse  skill sets they bring to the table. During the hackathon  they will also  be in close contact with the end users/federations that define the  hackathon topics.

This is  particularly true for demand forecasting and planning,  where the recent surge in data has prompted a paradigm shift.  Historically, forecasting was dominated by simple statistical  forecasting methods. However, machine learning-based forecasting  has recently outperformed all sales forecasting competitions with  superior performance. Despite these advancements, most companies still  rely heavily on simple statistical forecasting techniques.| In this seminar  three experts share their knowledge and  experience using AI in forecasting and demand planning. We showcase the  effectiveness of AI forecasting using tree-based machine learning and  outline the conditions in which these methods surpass popular  statistical approaches. Next  we will explore the essential elements of a  good AI demand/sales forecast beyond mere accuracy  delving into  probability forecasting  explainability  stability  and more. Finally   we provide a guide for achieving demand planning excellence through  objectives  data  metrics  models  and enrichment. We also discuss how  teams can enrich ML-generated forecasts using the famous forecast  value-added framework.

We pay attention to expressing these conclusions in a correct and understandable way.                               To emphasize the practical approach in this course all classes will take place in a pc room. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a statistical tool used in the comparison of means of a random variable over populations that differ in one or more characteristics (factors)  e.g. treatment  age  sex  subject  etc. First  we cover one-way ANOVA  where only one factor is of concern. Depending on the type of the factor  the conclusions pertain to just those factor levels included in the study (fixed factor model)  or to a population of factor levels of which we observed a sample (random effects model). In two-way and multi-way ANOVA where populations differ in more than one characteristic  the effects of factors are studied simultaneously. This yields information about the main effects of each of the factors as well as about any special joint effects (factorial design). We also consider nested designs  where each level of a second (mostly random) factor occurs in conjunction with only one level of the first factor. One special challenge in multi-way ANOVA lies in verifying the assumptions that must be satisfied. In this course we will focus on correct execution of data analysis and understanding its results. We pay attention to expressing these conclusions in a correct and understandable way. The different methods will be extensively illustrated with examples from scientific studies in a variety of fields. Exercises are worked out behind PC using the R software. Target audience This course targets professionals and investigators from diverse areas  who need to use statistical methods in the collection and handling of data in their research  in particular for assessing the effect of e.g. different treatments.

Following the symposium  Maarten Buyl will hold his public PhD defense on the topic of AI fairness.                               Over the past decade  concerns about the societal risks posed by AI systems have been steadily growing. AI systems have already been known to reinforce discriminatory biases  violate privacy  and manipulate public discourse. A wealth of technical work has been produced to assess and mitigate those risks  yet it is often based on simplistic assumptions of the role that AI plays in the real world.  The goal of this symposium is to tighten the link between technical viewpoints on the societal risks of AI and those from industry  law and policy. Hence  top experts in Belgium representing these diverse viewpoints  from within academia and without  will present their work and the challenges they face in addressing the societal risks of AI. Afterwards  they will participate in a panel discussion. The invited speakers are: Toon Calders (University of Antwerp)Jelle Hoedemaekers (Agoria)David Martens (University of Antwerp)Sofie Serwir (Permanent Representation of Belgium to the EU)Katrien Verbert (KU Leuven) Please refer to the website for details on the programme and registration.

Tidyverse is a collection of R-packages used for data wrangling and visualization that share a common design philosophy. The goal of this course is to get you up to speed with the most up-to-date and essential tidyverse tools for data exploration. After attending this course  you'll have the tools to tackle a wide variety of data wrangling and visualization challenges  using the best parts of R tidyverse. This course covers the most essential tools from 3 main R tidyverse packages that are frequently used in general data analysis procedure. Lectures with R code demonstrations are blended with hands-on exercises which allows you to try out the tools you've seen in the class under guides. What you will learn: Data transforming and summarizing with dplyr: narrowing in on observations of interest  creating new variables that are functions of existing variables  and calculating a set of summary statistics (like counts or means)Data visualization with ggplot2: creating more informative graphs (e.g.  scatter plot  bar plot  histogram  smoother/regression line  …) in an elegant and efficient way. Arranging multiple plots on a gridData ingest and tidying with tidyr: storing it in a consistent form that matches the semantics of the dataset with the way it is stored.Extra tools for programming: Merging and comparing two datasets based on various matching or filtering criterion. Other useful tools for R programming. Not included in this course: A systematic training guide in basics of R. If you never used R or RStudio before  we highly recommend you to take Module 2 of this year's program which will guide you to be familiar with the R environment for the implementation of data management and exploration tasks.Big data. This course focuses on small  in-memory datasets as you can't tackle big data easily unless you have experience with small data.Statistics. Although you will see many basic statistics in this course  the main focus is on R and the tidyverse tools instead of explaining the statistical concepts. Target audience This course targets anyone who wants to use R for data processing and needs to produce professional looking graphs and/or summary statistics.

The general aim is to conceive  physical machines that combine the reliability of discrete automata and  the robustness and adaptation of physical control systems. The theory of mixed feedback systems aims at leveraging the existing  theory of control  optimization  and learning while acknowledging the  inherent out-of-equilibrium nature of event-based machines. The theory is grounded in the operator-theoretic framework of maximal  monotonicity in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces. The course will  introduce those mathematical tools at a basic level and present how they  can be used to analyze and design neuromorphic event-based machines. The course consists of six sessions over three days. Each session will cover one of the following modules Module1: Feedback and memory (RS) 1.1. Examples of mixed feedback systems. Motivation. Current  limitations of control theory  machine learning  and neuromorphic  engineering. 1.2. Static mixed feedback 1.3. Dynamic mixed feedback. Questions and challenges Module 2: Feedback system analysis (TC) 2.1. Systems as operators. Phase and Gain. Monotonicity and Lipschitz operators. The passivity and the small-gain theorems. 2.2. Graphical representations. Nyquist plots. Scaled Relative Graphs. 2.3. Mixed feedback systems. Mixed gain and mixed phase feedback systems. Module 3: Feedback algorithms (TC) 3.1. Fixed point algorithms and zero finding algorithms. 3.2. Splitting algorithms and circuit representations 3.3. Algorithmic solutions of mixed feedback systems Module 4: Modelling at scale (RS) 4.1. Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces 4.2. Gradient systems in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces 4.3. Feedback neural networks at scale Module 5: Tuning at scale (RS) 5.1. Recursive least square estimation 5.2. A robust internal model principle for mixed feedback systems 5.3 Adaptive control and online learning at scale Module 6: Neuromorphic control (RS) 6.1. Physical Spiking Neural Networks 6.2. Control as neuromodulation at scale 6.3. Neuromorphic event-based machines Course material  Slides  exercises  and references will be available  Evaluation  An assignment that will be released during the course  The SOCN Graduate School gathers Belgian teams (UAntwerp  UNamur  KUL  UCLouvain  UGent  ULB  ULg  UMONS  VUB) active in the area of Systems  Optimization  Control and Networks  or have strong interest in topics related to it. The main objective of the Graduate School is to provide a high quality scientific environment and a well-balanced graduate-level program for the Belgian doctoral students in Systems  Optimization  Control and Networks. A common research theme pursued by the participating teams consists in the modelling of certain systems and phenomena with the purpose of controlling or optimizing their behavior and performance. These models are based on dynamical systems  differential (or difference) equations and mathematical programming formulations. Research of the participating teams focusses on the identification  analysis  control and optimization of these models  including the corresponding theory  algorithmic aspects and numerical resolution techniques. This area of growing interest finds numerous applications in various fields such as automatic control  biotechnology and biomedical engineering  mechanical and electrical engineering  production and supply chain management and planning  process engineering  robotics  routing  traffic or service networks and signal processing. |Mixed feedback systems  Eventbased technology is developing at a fast pace eg via  neuromorphic computing and eventbased cameras but we currently lack a  control theory of eventbased systems The general aim is to conceive  physical machines that combine the reliability of discrete automata and  the robustness and adaptation of physical control systems The theory of mixed feedback systems aims at leveraging the existing  theory of control  optimization  and learning while acknowledging the  inherent outofequilibrium nature of eventbased machines The theory is grounded in the operatortheoretic framework of maximal  monotonicity in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces The course will  introduce those mathematical tools at a basic level and present how they  can be used to analyze and design neuromorphic eventbased machines The course consists of six sessions over three days Each session will cover one of the following modules Module1 Feedback and memory RS 11 Examples of mixed feedback systems Motivation Current  limitations of control theory  machine learning  and neuromorphic  engineering 12 Static mixed feedback 13 Dynamic mixed feedback Questions and challenges Module 2 Feedback system analysis TC 21 Systems as operators Phase and Gain Monotonicity and Lipschitz operators The passivity and the smallgain theorems 22 Graphical representations Nyquist plots Scaled Relative Graphs 23 Mixed feedback systems Mixed gain and mixed phase feedback systems Module 3 Feedback algorithms TC 31 Fixed point algorithms and zero finding algorithms 32 Splitting algorithms and circuit representations 33 Algorithmic solutions of mixed feedback systems Module 4 Modelling at scale RS 41 Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces 42 Gradient systems in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces 43 Feedback neural networks at scale Module 5 Tuning at scale RS 51 Recursive least square estimation 52 A robust internal model principle for mixed feedback systems 53 Adaptive control and online learning at scale Module 6 Neuromorphic control RS 61 Physical Spiking Neural Networks 62 Control as neuromodulation at scale 63 Neuromorphic eventbased machines Course material  Slides  exercises  and references will be available  Evaluation  An assignment that will be released during the course  The SOCN Graduate School gathers Belgian teams UAntwerp  UNamur  KUL  UCLouvain  UGent  ULB  ULg  UMONS  VUB active in the area of Systems  Optimization  Control and Networks  or have strong interest in topics related to it The main objective of the Graduate School is to provide a high quality scientific environment and a wellbalanced graduatelevel program for the Belgian doctoral students in Systems  Optimization  Control and Networks A common research theme pursued by the participating teams consists in the modelling of certain systems and phenomena with the purpose of controlling or optimizing their behavior and performance These models are based on dynamical systems  differential or difference equations and mathematical programming formulations Research of the participating teams focusses on the identification  analysis  control and optimization of these models  including the corresponding theory  algorithmic aspects and numerical resolution techniques This area of growing interest finds numerous applications in various fields such as automatic control  biotechnology and biomedical engineering  mechanical and electrical engineering  production and supply chain management and planning  process engineering  robotics  routing  traffic or service networks and signal processing  Todays lecturers of this SOCN seminar are Rodolphe Sepulchre KU Leuven  University of CambridgeTom Chaffey University of Cambridge httpssitesuclouvainbesocndrupalsocnnode363 A seminar out of the SOCN seminar series on systems optimization control and networks seminarLeuvenSOCN Graduate School|['reliability', 'optimization', 'design', 'machine learning', 'neuromorphic  engineering', 'analysis', 'algorithms', 'algorithms', 'algorithms', 'algorithms', 'neural networks', 'estimation', 'Neural Networks', 'Evaluation', 'Optimization', 'Optimization', 'programming', 'optimization', 'robotics', 'processing', 'optimization']
