Today's challenge consists of predicting a client's average waiting time.| You find it hard to assess what information is correct? You miss a bigger picture?Are you feeling the pressure to upskill in AI  even though you don't have a background in it? You're not alone. Many developers are facing this challenge  but since you're great self-learners you continuously improve your skills by reading blogs  coding  and collaborating with colleagues. However  navigating the vast amount of information available can be overwhelming  and the lack of a proper framework makes it challenging to interpret this information correctly. Additionally  there is a lot of misinformation out there  making it difficult to separate accurate information from incomplete  unclear  or misleading information. Since going back to school for a degree in AI may not be a practical option for many of you  as it can be too theoretical and not directly applicable to your work we want to explore a new learning technique with you: a single day of training where you focus on solving a concrete problem which provides a framework for learning new concrete AI techniques. The teaching material is oriented around very concrete hands-on programming challenges. Each challenge aims to explain a certain AI technique.

However  many models behave as black boxes that can hide data biases  incorrect hypotheses or even software errors. In this talk  Maria Rodriguez Martinez (IBM Zürich) illustrates how interpretable deep learning models can achieve both high prediction accuracy and transparency. First  she will introduce multi-modal deep learning models that predict drug response while highlighting the genetic and chemical patterns that were more informative to make a prediction. Rodriguez Martinez also discusses how reinforcement learning approaches can facilitate the early phases of drug discovery and support the personalized design of new candidate compounds. Focusing next on T cell-based immunotherapies  she presents a model to predict the binding of T cell receptors and epitopes. This model can be coupled with an easy-to-use interpretable pipeline to extract the binding rules governing the T cell binding. These approaches are a first step towards the design and engineering of receptors of improved affinity. Finally  she will briefly discuss how interpretable models enable the linkage of different data modalities  such as image and molecular data. In doing so  they can pave the way to the development of personalized models of therapeutic interventions. |Interpretable deep learning for cancer personalized medicine  In recent years  deep learning models have resulted in outstanding breakthrough performances However  many models behave as black boxes that can hide data biases  incorrect hypotheses or even software errors In this talk  Maria Rodriguez Martinez IBM Zürich illustrates how interpretable deep learning models can achieve both high prediction accuracy and transparency First  she will introduce multimodal deep learning models that predict drug response while highlighting the genetic and chemical patterns that were more informative to make a prediction Rodriguez Martinez also discusses how reinforcement learning approaches can facilitate the early phases of drug discovery and support the personalized design of new candidate compounds Focusing next on T cellbased immunotherapies  she presents a model to predict the binding of T cell receptors and epitopes This model can be coupled with an easytouse interpretable pipeline to extract the binding rules governing the T cell binding These approaches are a first step towards the design and engineering of receptors of improved affinity Finally  she will briefly discuss how interpretable models enable the linkage of different data modalities  such as image and molecular data In doing so  they can pave the way to the development of personalized models of therapeutic interventions  More info  Share this course   httpswwwesatkuleuvenbestadiuseventphpid2349 2 May 2023 1030  1130 LezingLeuvenKU Leuven ESAT STADIUS

These concerns imply many responsibilities, opportunities for action, and frustrations for different stakeholders. Computer scientists and other academically-educated professionals (i.e., “us” as the presenters and audience of this talk) form one, or even several, of these stakeholder groups. How can we have a principled discussion about our responsibilities?| After an introductory example  in this talk  we will look into professional ethics codes for guidance  and ask how to make principled choices regarding the values that are often alluded to only loosely in these codes. We then focus on the value of reducing inequalities and avoiding discrimination. We take a critical look at 'de-biasing'  a term for an evolving set of computational methods that have received a lot of attention as potential answers to AI challenges from within the AI community. We open the discussion to explore how researchers’ action spaces can be enriched through interdisciplinary collaboration. We also ask how this focus on individual responsibilities can and must be complemented by structural adjustments. Last but not least  we aim at furthering participation opportunities through technology by organising this talk as a hybrid live event. |AI Ethics Fixing it  After an introductory example  in this talk  we will look into professional ethics codes for guidance  and ask how to make principled choices regarding the values that are often alluded to only loosely in these codes We then focus on the value of reducing inequalities and avoiding discrimination We take a critical look at debiasing  a term for an evolving set of computational methods that have received a lot of attention as potential answers to AI challenges from within the AI community We open the discussion to explore how researchers’ action spaces can be enriched through interdisciplinary collaboration We also ask how this focus on individual responsibilities can and must be complemented by structural adjustments Last but not least  we aim at furthering participation opportunities through technology by organising this talk as a hybrid live event  With the great current breakthroughs in AI and its deployment come great concerns about AI’s impact on society and the planet These concerns imply many responsibilities opportunities for action and frustrations for different stakeholders Computer scientists and other academicallyeducated professionals ie “us” as the presenters and audience of this talk form one or even several of these stakeholder groups How can we have a principled discussion about our responsibilities httpshiwkuleuvenbewgptel An evening talk about challenges of and approaches to applying professional ethics codes in Computer Science Evening lectureLeuven amp onlineKU Leuven Working Group on Philosophy of Technology

In engineering they have a paramount role in model-based simulation  health monitoring  control and optimization. The accuracy of the models is often crucial to their subsequent use in model-based operations. Data-driven modeling (system identification) and statistical parameter estimation are established fields for determining mathematical models of dynamical systems on the basis of measurement data from dedicated experiments. The 5-days Spring School aims at covering the fundamentals of data-driven modeling approaches (ranging from parameter estimation algorithms (PEM and ETFE) and experiment design to model validation) as well as more advanced topics. In this year edition  these advanced topics will pertain to closed-loop identification  to optimal experiment design and to the use of statistical tools (such as the maximum likelihood theory) for learning the dynamics of linear and nonlinear systems.  |Datadriven Model Learning of Dynamic Systems  Dynamical models play a key role in many branches of science In engineering they have a paramount role in modelbased simulation  health monitoring  control and optimization The accuracy of the models is often crucial to their subsequent use in modelbased operations Datadriven modeling system identification and statistical parameter estimation are established fields for determining mathematical models of dynamical systems on the basis of measurement data from dedicated experiments The 5days Spring School aims at covering the fundamentals of datadriven modeling approaches ranging from parameter estimation algorithms PEM and ETFE and experiment design to model validation as well as more advanced topics In this year edition  these advanced topics will pertain to closedloop identification  to optimal experiment design and to the use of statistical tools such as the maximum likelihood theory for learning the dynamics of linear and nonlinear systems   A fivedays PhD course on databased modeling system identification covering both the fundamentals and more advanced topics httpsspringid2023sciencesconforgresourcepageid8 6th Spring School Spring SchoolEcully FRLaboratoire Ampère CNRS GDR MACS amp École Centrale Lyon

Artificial intelligence systems provide robotics application new impressive perspectives, but also come with complex challenges.|" Often robotics and artificial intelligence are seen as the same. But many robots do not use artificial intelligence algorithms for the control of their behaviour. Their control is dependent on known models  and  based on these models  calculations and input data  a complex algorithm defines the output and hence the behaviour of the robot. ‍However  as such the system cannot learn. Artificial intelligence systems provide robotics application new impressive perspectives  but also come with complex challenges. For aspects like vision and speech recognition  deep learning has drastically outperformed traditional methods. These approaches typically require massive amounts of labelled data and computational power. Although data is typically abundant in robotics  labelling is sparse and expensive. For the control of robots  reinforcement learning often requires significantly more iterations than are feasible on real systems.‍ Therefore  a lot of the learning work is done in virtual environments  with challenges to transfer to the real world. Moreover  robots are interacting with the real world and challenges exist how to learn in a safe way  for the humans  for the environment and for the robot itself. ‍ Both methods  model-based control and learning methods  have disadvantages and advantages  and combining the best of both worlds is probably an interesting solution. Moreover like in animals and humans  due to millions years of evolution  the bodies are optimized for the tasks and the environment. Through a smart design with the use of new materials  actuators and sensor  part of the computational intelligence can be outsourced to the embodied intelligence of the robot body.‍ According to the paradox of Moravec “AI can quickly learn to perform tasks considered ""difficult"" by humans”  such as complex statistics and analysis. However  on the other hand  tasks that are trivial for humans  are often still exceedingly difficult for computers and robots.” Therefore instead of replacing humans by robots  there has been a lot of focus on developing collaborative robots to exploit these complementary strengths.

There is an interesting functional similitude between Chomsky’s generative grammars and the latest generative language models such as ChatGPT. They both generate language; they are able  broadly speaking  to convert an idea into various wordings  within the bounds of what is grammatical. They differ as well: Chomsky’s economizing principles stand in stark contrast with the careless ‘maximalism’ of Large Language Models  fueled by the motto “there’s no data like more data”. How do these models relate to each other  and also with respect to an important third model  the human language system  implemented in countless independent brains? Drawing on linguistic  computational and neurobiological research I discuss how these different views offer explanations for individual language variation  by focusing on the building bricks  the ‘finite means’  they appear to be using. |The building bricks of language  Language makes infinite use of finite means  as Chomsky would have it There is an interesting functional similitude between Chomsky’s generative grammars and the latest generative language models such as ChatGPT They both generate language they are able  broadly speaking  to convert an idea into various wordings  within the bounds of what is grammatical They differ as well Chomsky’s economizing principles stand in stark contrast with the careless ‘maximalism’ of Large Language Models  fueled by the motto “there’s no data like more data” How do these models relate to each other  and also with respect to an important third model  the human language system  implemented in countless independent brains Drawing on linguistic  computational and neurobiological research I discuss how these different views offer explanations for individual language variation  by focusing on the building bricks  the ‘finite means’  they appear to be using  More info  Share this course   httpskulakkuleuvenbenloverkulakfaculteitenletterenonderzoekfrancquileerstoel2023lezingenfrancquileerstoel2023seminarsfrancquichair2023 24 Feb 2023 1500  1700 SeminarLeuvenKU Leuven Kulak

Recent studies used reinforcement learning to solve challenging problems such as wind farm control, epidemic mitigation, and robot control.| Reinforcement learning concerns a distinct branch in the field of machine learning. While supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques learn based on a set of instances  reinforcement learning concerns an agent that learns by interacting with an environment. To illustrate this setting  consider a video game  where the agent identifies as the player of the game. The environment concerns the video game that can be controlled with a gamepad and observed by looking at the screen. The agent receives feedback from the environment in terms of rewards  for example via a game score. Based on this feedback and the observations of the environment  a reinforcement learning agent aims at learning to play the game optimally  by interacting repeatedly with the environment. In this course  we will study both the reinforcement learning problem and the algorithms that can be used to approach such problems. Over the last years  several important milestones were achieved using the reinforcement learning framework  such as learning to play ATARI 2600 video games  learning to play the board game Go to beat the number one human player and learning to reach grandmaster performance in the real-time strategy game Starcraft II. However  reinforcement learning is no longer limited to games  as many real-world problems can be formulated as a reinforcement learning problem. Recent studies used reinforcement learning to solve challenging problems such as wind farm control  epidemic mitigation  and robot control. In this course  we will convey the fundamentals that underlie reinforcement learning. To achieve this  we will start from intuition and applications to move towards formalisms that can implement a reinforcement learning agent. To move from formalisms to practice  we will explore these concepts in a grid-world environment using the python programming language. 10:00-12:00 Lecture13:00-15:00 Practical Session |A deep dive into reinforcement learning  Reinforcement learning concerns a distinct branch in the field of machine learning While supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques learn based on a set of instances  reinforcement learning concerns an agent that learns by interacting with an environment To illustrate this setting  consider a video game  where the agent identifies as the player of the game The environment concerns the video game that can be controlled with a gamepad and observed by looking at the screen The agent receives feedback from the environment in terms of rewards  for example via a game score Based on this feedback and the observations of the environment  a reinforcement learning agent aims at learning to play the game optimally  by interacting repeatedly with the environment In this course  we will study both the reinforcement learning problem and the algorithms that can be used to approach such problems Over the last years  several important milestones were achieved using the reinforcement learning framework  such as learning to play ATARI 2600 video games  learning to play the board game Go to beat the number one human player and learning to reach grandmaster performance in the realtime strategy game Starcraft II However  reinforcement learning is no longer limited to games  as many realworld problems can be formulated as a reinforcement learning problem Recent studies used reinforcement learning to solve challenging problems such as wind farm control  epidemic mitigation  and robot control In this course  we will convey the fundamentals that underlie reinforcement learning To achieve this  we will start from intuition and applications to move towards formalisms that can implement a reinforcement learning agent To move from formalisms to practice  we will explore these concepts in a gridworld environment using the python programming language 10001200 Lecture13001500 Practical Session  Reinforcement learning is no longer limited to games as many realworld problems can be formulated as a reinforcement learning problem Recent studies used reinforcement learning to solve challenging problems such as wind farm control epidemic mitigation and robot control httpswwwflamesstatisticscomiucourses64 Using reinforcement learning to solve challenging real world problems CourseBrusselsVAIA amp Flames

More specifically, the second episode will tackle the topic “What does the use of algorithms mean for the autonomy of teachers?” Three speakers will share their experience and insights on the issue.| Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data-driven educational practices are increasingly used in schools across the world  promising a revolution in the way teaching is taking place and students learn. However  the increase in the integration of such technologies in formal education contexts has raised multiple questions around ethical uses  privacy  and security of students  as well as questions about the role of the teacher in this new schooling context. We will discuss questions such as: How is data used for learning? What are the potential benefits that data-driven practices can bring? What are the limitations? What does it mean when the algorithms take decisions that usually the teacher take? What are the necessary steps to ensure teachers possess the right skills and competences to make best use of this data? How can we agree on a way forward that harnesses the benefits of AI without compromising students’ privacy and teachers’ agency?

Willems  remained till recently an esoteric niche of research. The renewed interest in the last years is because of its unique suitability for the newly emerged data-driven paradigm  specifically the representation-free perspective on dynamical systems as sets of trajectories. A result derived in the behavioral setting that became known as the fundamental lemma started a new class of subspace-type data-driven methods. The fundamental lemma gives conditions for a non-parametric representation of a linear time-invariant system by the image of a Hankel matrix constructed from raw time series data. This course reviews the fundamental lemma  its generalizations  and related data-driven analysis  signal processing  and control methods. A prototypical signal processing problem considered in the course is interpolation and approximation of trajectories. It includes simulation  state estimation  and output tracking control as special cases. The theory leads to computationally tractable methods. Regularized version of the methods is robust to noise and model assumptions. Participants will get hands-on experience with the methods via Matlab exercises and individual work on mini-projects. The course consists of six 2.5-hour sessions. A session starts with an introduction  followed by questions-and-answers and exercises. After the third session  students will choose mini-projects to work on. The course will not cover a fixed curriculum and will be adapted as much as possible to the need and interests of the participants. An indicative outline of topics that will be discussed in the course is: Dynamical systems as sets of trajectoriesComplexity of a linear time-invariant systemParametric representations of a bounded complexity linear time-invariant systemControllability and control in the behavioral settingData-driven non-parametric model representationThe fundamental lemmaIdentifiability and the most powerful unfalsified modelGeneralizations of the fundamental lemmaData-driven interpolation and approximation of trajectoriesExistence and uniqueness of an exact interpolantMixed interpolation and approximationRecursive computationDealing with inexact/noisy dataNaive approach: using the pseudo-inverseStructured low-rank pre-processingNuclear-norm and \(\ell_1\)-norm regularizationGeneralizations to nonlinear systemsPolynomial time-invariant systemsHammerstein  finite-lag Volterra  and bilinear systemsLinear time-invariant embeddingApplicationsInput estimationInternal navigationDynamic measurement |Behavioral approach to system theory  The behavioral approach to systems theory  put forward 40 years ago by Jan C Willems  remained till recently an esoteric niche of research The renewed interest in the last years is because of its unique suitability for the newly emerged datadriven paradigm  specifically the representationfree perspective on dynamical systems as sets of trajectories A result derived in the behavioral setting that became known as the fundamental lemma started a new class of subspacetype datadriven methods The fundamental lemma gives conditions for a nonparametric representation of a linear timeinvariant system by the image of a Hankel matrix constructed from raw time series data This course reviews the fundamental lemma  its generalizations  and related datadriven analysis  signal processing  and control methods A prototypical signal processing problem considered in the course is interpolation and approximation of trajectories It includes simulation  state estimation  and output tracking control as special cases The theory leads to computationally tractable methods Regularized version of the methods is robust to noise and model assumptions Participants will get handson experience with the methods via Matlab exercises and individual work on miniprojects The course consists of six 25hour sessions A session starts with an introduction  followed by questionsandanswers and exercises After the third session  students will choose miniprojects to work on The course will not cover a fixed curriculum and will be adapted as much as possible to the need and interests of the participants An indicative outline of topics that will be discussed in the course is Dynamical systems as sets of trajectoriesComplexity of a linear timeinvariant systemParametric representations of a bounded complexity linear timeinvariant systemControllability and control in the behavioral settingDatadriven nonparametric model representationThe fundamental lemmaIdentifiability and the most powerful unfalsified modelGeneralizations of the fundamental lemmaDatadriven interpolation and approximation of trajectoriesExistence and uniqueness of an exact interpolantMixed interpolation and approximationRecursive computationDealing with inexactnoisy dataNaive approach using the pseudoinverseStructured lowrank preprocessingNuclearnorm and ell1norm regularizationGeneralizations to nonlinear systemsPolynomial timeinvariant systemsHammerstein  finitelag Volterra  and bilinear systemsLinear timeinvariant embeddingApplicationsInput estimationInternal navigationDynamic measurement  More info  Share this course   httpssitesuclouvainbesocnnode53 14 Nov 2022  9 Dec 2022 6day courseLeuvenSOCN

Therefore it's important to apply some measures on the data to reduce the risk of disclosing sensitive information as much as possible. In this course we focus on the techniques in Statistical disclosure control to minimize the amount of personal data in data sets.| Legitimacy of data-driven research and success of data-intensive applications depend on protecting privacy in the design  realisation  deployment and maintenance of these studies and systems. Personal Data Minimization (PDM) is a core principle of privacy protection  whereby the amount of personal data in data sets is adjusted to the level needed for the legitimate data usage in mind (i.e.  for the aimed study or system functionality). Mainly  Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) tools and mechanisms are used for the PDM of micro and tabular data sets. SDC technology aims at mitigating the disclosure of privacy sensitive information to adversaries who have access to the content of such data sets. Applying SDC methods is necessary before storing the data sets  sharing them with scientific community or partner organisations  or opening them to the public. Using a SDC tool  an expert can apply advanced SDC algorithms with proper parameters to a data set (i.e.  transform the data set)  gain insights into the utility of the original and the transformed data sets  estimate the data disclosure risks of the original and the transformed data sets  and eventually make appropriate trade-offs between the indicators of data utility and data disclosure risks. The task of applying SDC into practice  however  increasingly becomes difficult due to the growth of data volume  variety  velocity ... and the availability of background information to adversaries. Data growth makes it difficult to detect potential privacy issues hidden in data sets (relating to the intrinsic characteristics of data sets) and background information makes it difficult to assess the potential risks when combining sensitive data sets with other ones (relating to the extrinsic characteristics of data sets). prerequisite knowledge: Being familiar with basics of mathematicsUsed tools: ARX and ARXaaSDuration: Four half-day sessions (each of about 3 hours)  organized in two consecutive days 1: Introduction by Mortaza S.

Artificial intelligence and contract formation|https://www.vaia.be/en/courses/artificial-intelligence-and-contract-formation|19/10/2022|Conference-Leuven-KU Leuven|19 Oct 2022 09:00 - 17:20|English|Aula Arenbergkasteel and livestream|Target audience: Everybody||No|€130|https://www.law.kuleuven.be/apps/activiteiten/activities/5977#5977|Conference|Systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly present in our daily lives. Although these systems generally produce outstanding results, they are also imperfect, just like human beings. While the added value of these systems is that they are able to match or exceed human performance in a way that is both faster and cheaper, a fundamental challenge remains that it is impossible to rule out occasional incorrect results.| Consequently  the legal relevance of AI systems is growing rapidly  especially when these systems are used to support a party in the process of contract formation. This seminar focuses on four applications in which parties may consider an AI system’s analysis in the decision (not) to conclude a contract. To begin with  AI systems are increasingly being used to support due diligence in M&A transactions. In an HR context  these systems are relied upon to analyse resumes or employee performance. AI systems are used as a contracting tool in the banking and insurance sector as well  e.g. to quickly assess the situation and work out an appropriate settlement that the other party is likely to accept. Finally  these systems can also be used in the art sector to assess the authenticity of a piece of art. These applications can help support the work of lawyers and in-house counsel. However  because AI systems are not flawless  they can also give rise to disputes. The resolution of such disputes depends on the difficult assessment of whether a party was entitled to rely on the AI system in given situation  and on the identification of the relevant legal regime. To facilitate this analysis  lawyers  company lawyers and judges may benefit from a basic understanding of the advantages and legal challenges of the use of AI systems to support contract formation  which will be discussed during this seminar. 09:00 - 09:10 uur: Opening remarks Prof. dr.

The  workshop covers three topics: Implementing AI in Control RoomsPredictive AnalyticsBusiness Integration (managerial focus) By Francesco Corman - Chair of Transport Systems at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology  ETH Zurich We review different challenges and opportunities for traffic control  in railway systems. From the point of view of sensing  state estimation  and data fusion must be performed in a very short time  and for units  that are typically spatially dispersed. From the point of view of  determining a control objective to support automatic decisions  the  challenge is how to understand the impact of a decision in terms of  system performance. Almost all of those problems have to deal with  unknown future states  which must be predicted  typically by model-based  or black box approaches  also based on advanced analytics. Once an  objective function and optimization variables are determined   optimization models can help to find a solution quickly and effectively.  Further challenges are the acceptance of decision stakeholders  within  the control room  but also within the travelers and operators  or the  direct implementation of automatic digital control. For  passenger-oriented traffic control  this is particularly interesting and  challenging  due to the large amount of possible decisions per decision  maker  and data that can partially describe those aspects  which calls  for machine learning approaches. To reach all those goals  the system  must have room for control  in another sense  flexibility in operations  must be built in already from the planning  to be exploited in the  real-time horizon when needed. by Leon Sobrie - On Track Lab Digitisation and employee workload (im)balance are intertwined. To address undesirable workload peaks and lows  we propose a 2-step machine learning model to provide real-time workload analytics per controller in digital safety-critical control rooms. The advocated model leverages a rich real-time data structure with disaggregated event-level taskload data. Next to exploring different machine and deep learning approaches  we compare the performance of a model that predicts aggregate workload with the performance of the aggregate of different models that predict specific task loads. We develop a business application that utilizes the proposed model to provide detailed predictive analytics that open the black box of workload imbalance and  in this way  empowers the control room manager with real-time insights. by Christophe Hurter - ENAC The Decision Making Process is already associated with AI. The algorithms are meant to help ATCOs in daily tasks  but they still face acceptability issues. Today’s automation systems with AI/Machine Learning do not provide additional information on top of the Data Processing result to support its explanation  making them not transparent enough. The Decision Making Process is expected to become a “White Box”  giving understandable outcome through an understandable process. XAI SOLUTIONS: Transparency and Explainability: ARTIMATION’s goal is providing a transparent and explainable AI model through visualization  data driven storytelling and immersive analytics.

EUROCONTROL recognized these needs when publishing its white papers on Resilience Engineering almost 15 years ago. The project called “Weak Signal” continued on that side. Besides the theoretical foundation on weak signals definition  detection and management  one of this project’s outputs is the development of a novel tool called SECA (Structured Exploration of Complex Adaptations). SECA helps detecting weak signals in normal air traffic management operations  creating shared organizational knowledge. This latter arises from a collaborative elicitation process that span from tacit and explicit dimensions. SECA is designed to support data gathering and data analysis  integrating traditional thematic analyses with modern Natural Language Processing. The presentation will show the early results of its adoption in two different European ANSPs and the way to scale it up from a prototype to a full-fledged solution  also including the possibility to use the same approach in other industries.   |The control room of the future  AI empowered dashboards  A special focus will be given to control rooms as this sector is  increasing in importance with

Professionals in this domain, however, might struggle to keep up with the fast-paced developments in recent years. In particular the recent and impressive emergence of neural networks in machine learning as a go-to paradigm has rapidly altered the state of the art in artificial intelligence and challenges existing computational approaches to text. This micro-credential has been carved out as a balanced selection of contemporary modules from the MA in Digital Text Analysis that targets industry professionals who are interested in learning about modern machine learning and natural language processing. With an emphasis on project and team work, we develop practical applications on textual data, as well as solutions for the many issues that remain open in the field.| This micro-credential is a targeted subset from the MA in Digital Text Analysis and singles a teaching track in natural language processing. None of the modules overlap in time  allowing students to engage at a reasonable pace  over the course of the first and second semester. This micro-credential focuses on the following learning outcomes. 1. The participant will have theoretical knowledge about the history and the main frameworks of Machine Learning. 2. The participant will have theoretical knowledge of the main machine learning algorithms and paradigms and will study some of them in depth. 3. The participant will be able to develop machine learning pipelines and set up their own machine learning experiments using Python modules. 4. The participant will have theoretical and practical knowledge of machine learning using neural networks. 5. The participant will understand the fundamental problems and approaches in automatic Natural Language Processing and know its history as a subfield within Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence. 6. The participant will have insight into the basic algorithms developed within NLP for morphological  syntactic  semantic  and discourse processing. 7. The participant will acquire hands-on experience with software for text categorization  language understanding  translation  and generation. All courses extensively rely on weekly  hands-on homework assignments  ensuring the acquisition of new  practical insights on a regular basis. The homework takes the form of engaging assignments on real-world datasets that challenge the students to apply the theoretical concept introduced during the interactive class sessions.The final evaluation of all three courses depends on project work  the goal and finality of which can be determined by the individual students  in close correspondence with the course teachers.An attractive feature of the evaluation of the NLP course (in the 2nd semester) is that students will participate in an ongoing shared task in the field. |Machine Learning of Natural Language Processing  This microcredential is a targeted subset from the MA in Digital Text Analysis and singles a teaching track in natural language processing None of the modules overlap in time  allowing students to engage at a reasonable pace  over the course of the first and second semester This microcredential focuses on the following learning outcomes 1 The participant will have theoretical knowledge about the history and the main frameworks of Machine Learning 2 The participant will have theoretical knowledge of the main machine learning algorithms and paradigms and will study some of them in depth 3 The participant will be able to develop machine learning pipelines and set up their own machine learning experiments using Python modules 4 The participant will have theoretical and practical knowledge of machine learning using neural networks 5 The participant will understand the fundamental problems and approaches in automatic Natural Language Processing and know its history as a subfield within Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence 6 The participant will have insight into the basic algorithms developed within NLP for morphological  syntactic  semantic  and discourse processing 7 The participant will acquire handson experience with software for text categorization  language understanding  translation  and generation All courses extensively rely on weekly  handson homework assignments  ensuring the acquisition of new  practical insights on a regular basis The homework takes the form of engaging assignments on realworld datasets that challenge the students to apply the theoretical concept introduced during the interactive class sessionsThe final evaluation of all three courses depends on project work  the goal and finality of which can be determined by the individual students  in close correspondence with the course teachersAn attractive feature of the evaluation of the NLP course in the 2nd semester is that students will participate in an ongoing shared task in the field  Natural Language Processing is an integral component to applications of data science across the technological industry nowadays Professionals in this domain however might struggle to keep up with the fastpaced developments in recent years In particular the recent and impressive emergence of neural networks in machine learning as a goto paradigm has rapidly altered the state of the art in artificial intelligence and challenges existing computational approaches to text This microcredential has been carved out as a balanced selection of contemporary modules from the MA in Digital Text Analysis that targets industry professionals who are interested in learning about modern machine learning and natural language processing With an emphasis on project and team work we develop practical applications on textual data as well as solutions for the many issues that remain open in the field httpswwwuantwerpenbeenstudyprogrammesallprogrammesmachinelearning Ignite your skills in artificial intelligence for language technology​​ Microcredential 12 ECTSAntwerpenUAntwerp

Mental  social  and health-related processes can all change and adapt over time with human behaviour. Thought-based processes can change as a result of learning  social interactions can evolve over time  and health-related processes are susceptible to change too.This course will present theories and findings from a wide range of disciplines  including various branches of cognitive  social  health and neuroscience  to gain insight into underlying mechanisms of human processes that can be exploited in human AI modeling and simulation. The various scientific theories form a factual basis for modelling the processes. We can understand these often adaptive mechanisms through causal relations and causal pathways  which we can model as networks. Using this theoretical framework and the software provided  students can easily simulate a variety of scenarios.During the second week  students will carry out activities that could lay the foundations for a publication that can be finished later on in the course.This course introduces a network-oriented modelling approach based on adaptive networks. This approach is useful for modelling social interactions and mental and health-related processes within their respective networks.These network models cover the dynamics of causal effects  changing causal connections and excitability or sensitivity thresholds. Higher-order adaptiveness is another topic covered in the course  which includes the role of metaplasticity and the extent to which plasticity occurs in the field of cognitive neuroscience.Assessment is based on the assignments. In the second week of the course  a final assignment is addressed  which might be worked out to a paper that may be submitted to an international conference  where it could be presented and provided a publication. For this  support is provided also after the course.  |Human AI  Human processes of all kinds are complex and adaptive Mental  social  and healthrelated processes can all change and adapt over time with human behaviour Thoughtbased processes can change as a result of learning  social interactions can evolve over time  and healthrelated processes are susceptible to change tooThis course will present theories and findings from a wide range of disciplines  including various branches of cognitive  social  health and neuroscience  to gain insight into underlying mechanisms of human processes that can be exploited in human AI modeling and simulation The various scientific theories form a factual basis for modelling the processes We can understand these often adaptive mechanisms through causal relations and causal pathways  which we can model as networks Using this theoretical framework and the software provided  students can easily simulate a variety of scenariosDuring the second week  students will carry out activities that could lay the foundations for a publication that can be finished later on in the courseThis course introduces a networkoriented modelling approach based on adaptive networks This approach is useful for modelling social interactions and mental and healthrelated processes within their respective networksThese network models cover the dynamics of causal effects  changing causal connections and excitability or sensitivity thresholds Higherorder adaptiveness is another topic covered in the course  which includes the role of metaplasticity and the extent to which plasticity occurs in the field of cognitive neuroscienceAssessment is based on the assignments In the second week of the course  a final assignment is addressed  which might be worked out to a paper that may be submitted to an international conference  where it could be presented and provided a publication For this  support is provided also after the course   More info  Share this course   httpswwwsummerschoolsineuropeeucourse16503humanai 18 Jul 2022  21 Jul 2022 summer schoolAmsterdamFree University of Amsterdam

In a nutshell  Libratus is a decision-making agent that takes decisions in an uncertain environment  exploring the potential consequences of their own choices using complex estimates of the world around. This course is a study of the basic building blocks of decision-making agents  which are abstract entities living in an uncertain environment and are guided towards the realisation of given objectives. An agent is typically endowed with a knowledge base  a collection of facts expressed in some logical language  and an action repertoire at each state. The agent can reason about the environment  using their knowledge base  and take decisions accordingly. The environment is typically unknown  stochastic  and evolves following some rules that might be unknown to the agent  as well. On top of this  it is usually inhabited by other agents  which may or may not strive to achieve similar objectives. The task is to take the best possible decision that can be taken given the (incomplete) information available. This simple model is the basis of a number of important achievements in AI  and combines the use of logical  game-theoretic and algorithmic analysis. |Introduction to Artificial Intelligence  In December 2017  Carnegie Mellon poker playing computer Libratus has stunned the world by winning 17M in a 20 days tournament against four poker stars In a nutshell  Libratus is a decisionmaking agent that takes decisions in an uncertain environment  exploring the potential consequences of their own choices using complex estimates of the world around This course is a study of the basic building blocks of decisionmaking agents  which are abstract entities living in an uncertain environment and are guided towards the realisation of given objectives An agent is typically endowed with a knowledge base  a collection of facts expressed in some logical language  and an action repertoire at each state The agent can reason about the environment  using their knowledge base  and take decisions accordingly The environment is typically unknown  stochastic  and evolves following some rules that might be unknown to the agent  as well On top of this  it is usually inhabited by other agents  which may or may not strive to achieve similar objectives The task is to take the best possible decision that can be taken given the incomplete information available This simple model is the basis of a number of important achievements in AI  and combines the use of logical  gametheoretic and algorithmic analysis  More info  Share this course   httpswarwickacukstudysummerwithwarwickwarwicksummerschoolcoursesartificialintelligence 17 Jul 2022  6 Aug 2022 summer schoolWarwick United KingdomUniversity of Warwick

Johan Loeckx (VUB) will  dive into the concept ‘AI’ where you will learn what is considered  artificial intelligence and what not. He will give an overview of the  field and talk about some current trends. As director of lifelong  learning at the AI Lab (LAIKA) he is well suited to discuss the steps that are necessary to implement AI in your workflow.  In this session we go into depth on the data based algorithms called  machine and deep learning techniques. Prof. dr. Dirk Valkenborg  (UHasselt) will show different kinds of algorithms like supervised and  unsupervised learning methods and discuss the basic terminology  involved. Being a researcher at the Data Science Institute (DSI) and the Flanders AI Research program (FLAIR)  he gives an insight on some of his own projects which are relevant to the pharmaceutical industry (also see SPEED-XM). It’s important to collect relevant data in order to start these  machine learning pipelines. Having experience in MS research and the MS Data Alliance  and expertise on data integration and engineering  Tina and Marcel  Parciak (UHasselt) discuss how you can scale up your health data by  combining data from different repositories. Centralised and federated  approaches might be possible but still need a common language. Therefore  a common data model like OMOP can provide a solution. In this session  we discuss the different challenges regarding these topics and give an  overview of the OHDSI toolbox that accelerates OMOPification.

The proposed AI Act classifies the application of AI in employment and management as a high-risk area  due to their potential impact on “career prospects and livelihoods of workers” by “perpetuating historical patterns of discrimination”. However  recent expositions of algorithmic management in warehouses and online platforms show that concerns about AI in the workplace should extend beyond career prospects and livelihoods into job quality and worker wellbeing. In this paper  we review the existing evidence on AI’s potential effects – both positive and negative – on current job quality trends  using Eurofound’s seven-dimensional job quality framework. |The impact of AI on job quality need for enlarged regulatory scope  Regulating AI is high on the European policy agenda The proposed AI Act classifies the application of AI in employment and management as a highrisk area  due to their potential impact on “career prospects and livelihoods of workers” by “perpetuating historical patterns of discrimination” However  recent expositions of algorithmic management in warehouses and online platforms show that concerns about AI in the workplace should extend beyond career prospects and livelihoods into job quality and worker wellbeing In this paper  we review the existing evidence on AI’s potential effects – both positive and negative – on current job quality trends  using Eurofound’s sevendimensional job quality framework  More info  Share this course   httpsaikuleuvenbeeventstheimpactofaionjobqualityneedforenlargedregulatoryscope 27 Apr 2022 1830  2000 lectureLeuvenKU Leuven

Given an image-caption pair  the goal is to extract a shared hierarchical structure for both image and language simultaneously. We argue that such structured output  grounded in both modalities  is a clear step towards the high-level understanding of multimodal information. Besides challenges existing in conventional visually grounded grammar induction tasks  VL grammar induction requires a model to capture contextual semantics and perform a fine-grained alignment. To address these challenges  we propose a novel method  CLIORA  which constructs a shared vision-language constituency tree structure with context-dependent semantics for all possible phrases in different levels of the tree. It computes a matching score between each constituent and image region  trained via contrastive learning. It integrates two levels of fusion  namely at feature-level and at score-level  so as to allow fine-grained alignment. We introduce a new evaluation metric for VL grammar induction  CCRA  and show a 3.3% improvement over a strong baseline on Flickr30k Entities. We also evaluate our model via two derived tasks  i.e.  language grammar induction and phrase grounding  and improve over the state-of-the-art for both. Authors: Bo Wan (Speaker)  Wenjuan Han  Zilong Zheng  Tinne Tuytelaars In recent years  we have seen significant steps taken in the development of self-driving cars. Multiple companies are starting to roll out impressive systems that work in a variety of settings. These systems can sometimes give the impression that full self-driving is just around the corner and that we would soon build cars without even a steering wheel. The increase in the level of autonomy and control given to an AI provides an opportunity for new modes of human-vehicle interaction. However  surveys have shown that giving more control to an AI in self-driving cars is accompanied by a degree of uneasiness by passengers. In an attempt to alleviate this issue  recent works have taken a natural language-oriented approach by allowing the passenger to give commands that refer to specific objects in the visual scene. Nevertheless  this is only half the task as the car should also understand the physical destination of the command  which is what we focus on in this paper. We propose an extension in which we annotate the 3D destination that the car needs to reach after executing the given command and evaluate multiple different baselines on predicting this destination location. Additionally  we introduce a model that outperforms the prior works adapted for this particular setting.

Each of the major course modules will be briefly introduced and motivated. 2 : Security & Privacy (S&P) Engineering and Regulations (4 April  14-17.30h) Module 2A The covering of S&P requirements is a matter of running a significant security project  albeit efficiently. There is no such thing as the ultimate approach  but rather a range of measures and activities that can be applied to strengthen the S&P posture. This can be at the level of requirements and specification  at the level of coding  in security testing  etc. This module will cover the overall landscape and zoom into some of the most promising techniques. Relevant themes of this session include: Threat modelling and risk assessmentArchitectures and blueprintsRegulations and complianceModule 2B Security and privacy requirements are typically not only of a technical nature  they also and largely emerge from the demand to be compliant with policies and regulations. In the second module of Security & Privacy Engineering  we zoom into the most relevant regulations and discuss how we can work towards compliance. In addition  we discuss how this concern can be addressed as an integrated part of the overall development and engineering process.Z 3 : Cryptography: basic & advanced techniques (5 April  10-13h) Many protection techniques and technologies are at hand. It goes without saying that cryptography is an essential building block at the heart of data protection  and thus essential for the delivery of S&P requirements. The machine learning pipeline needs protection of training data  production data and models. This challenging environment demands for fairly advanced techniques. Module 3A In the module Cryptography I  we revisit the basics of cryptography to make sure that all attendants can refresh their existing knowledge on the subject matter. Module 3B In the module Advanced Cryptography and Data Protection  we elaborate on the most recent advances and techniques that can contribute to securing advanced data sharing in distributed AI. Relevant themes of this session include: Data storage in the new centuryData processing: an overview of cryptographic protectionMPC intro and applicationsFHE state-of-the-art and implicationsProtection of data in motion4 : Security and privacy posture of a Machine Learning architecture (5 April  14-17h) In this module  we revisit the architecture and operational environment of a machine learning application and analyze the values of contributions of known security techniques. Relevant themes of this session include: Attack surface: data  model  process and data flowThreat modelling for AI and known challengesAdversaries and their capabilitiesArchitectural and algorithmic defencesSecurity and privacy challenges in Federated Machine Learning5 : Adversarial Machine Learning (6 April  14-17h) In this module  we zoom into the specific challenge of achieving robustness and reliability when facing adversaries that attempt to fool the ML application by feeding disturbing data into  e.g. a classifier. This type of attack is typical to the setting of a ML environment and deserves significant attention. Relevant themes of this session include: Vulnerabilities in ML systems; overview of ML specific attacksProtection against adversarial examplesEvaluation and robustness of solutionsPrivacy aspects6 : Case Studies (7 April  10-13h) In this module  we discuss and analyze some case studies and apply the knowhow of this course to a specific application  for example in the context of authentication systems. Relevant themes of this session include: Face recognition revisitedBiometrics and challengesAnomaly detection7 : Workshops (7 April  14-17h & 8 April  10-17h) In this module  we organize – if so desired – interactive workshops with smaller groups of attendants who may share an interest in a common application domain. The goal is to validate which elements of the course can be applied to an application domain or case that is well understood by a team of course attendants. The practical approach and organization of this last module will depend on the engagement and input that is provided by the participants. |Security amp Privacy of Artificial Intelligence Challenges and Solutions for Machine Learning Applications  1  Introduction 4 April 1013h This module is an overall course introduction  sketching all the facets and aspects of securing a system or service in general  and of a data driven application based on ML in particular Each of the major course modules will be briefly introduced and motivated 2  Security  Privacy SP Engineering and Regulations 4 April  141730h Module 2A The covering of SP requirements is a matter of running a significant security project  albeit efficiently There is no such thing as the ultimate approach  but rather a range of measures and activities that can be applied to strengthen the SP posture This can be at the level of requirements and specification  at the level of coding  in security testing  etc This module will cover the overall landscape and zoom into some of the most promising techniques Relevant themes of this session include Threat modelling and risk assessmentArchitectures and blueprintsRegulations and complianceModule 2B Security and privacy requirements are typically not only of a technical nature  they also and largely emerge from the demand to be compliant with policies and regulations In the second module of Security  Privacy Engineering  we zoom into the most relevant regulations and discuss how we can work towards compliance In addition  we discuss how this concern can be addressed as an integrated part of the overall development and engineering processZ 3  Cryptography basic  advanced techniques 5 April  1013h Many protection techniques and technologies are at hand It goes without saying that cryptography is an essential building block at the heart of data protection  and thus essential for the delivery of SP requirements The machine learning pipeline needs protection of training data  production data and models This challenging environment demands for fairly advanced techniques Module 3A In the module Cryptography I  we revisit the basics of cryptography to make sure that all attendants can refresh their existing knowledge on the subject matter Module 3B In the module Advanced Cryptography and Data Protection  we elaborate on the most recent advances and techniques that can contribute to securing advanced data sharing in distributed AI Relevant themes of this session include Data storage in the new centuryData processing an overview of cryptographic protectionMPC intro and applicationsFHE stateoftheart and implicationsProtection of data in motion4  Security and privacy posture of a Machine Learning architecture 5 April  1417h In this module  we revisit the architecture and operational environment of a machine learning application and analyze the values of contributions of known security techniques Relevant themes of this session include Attack surface data  model  process and data flowThreat modelling for AI and known challengesAdversaries and their capabilitiesArchitectural and algorithmic defencesSecurity and privacy challenges in Federated Machine Learning5  Adversarial Machine Learning 6 April  1417h In this module  we zoom into the specific challenge of achieving robustness and reliability when facing adversaries that attempt to fool the ML application by feeding disturbing data into  eg a classifier This type of attack is typical to the setting of a ML environment and deserves significant attention Relevant themes of this session include Vulnerabilities in ML systems overview of ML specific attacksProtection against adversarial examplesEvaluation and robustness of solutionsPrivacy aspects6  Case Studies 7 April  1013h In this module  we discuss and analyze some case studies and apply the knowhow of this course to a specific application  for example in the context of authentication systems Relevant themes of this session include Face recognition revisitedBiometrics and challengesAnomaly detection7  Workshops 7 April  1417h  8 April  1017h In this module  we organize – if so desired – interactive workshops with smaller groups of attendants who may share an interest in a common application domain The goal is to validate which elements of the course can be applied to an application domain or case that is well understood by a team of course attendants The practical approach and organization of this last module will depend on the engagement and input that is provided by the participants  Learn how to apply security and privacy measures when creating algorithms models proofofconcepts and finally implementing these in solutions httpscybersecurityresearchbeaisecurityprivacy Challenges and Solutions for Machine Learning Applications 5day courseLeuvenKU Leuven COSIC amp Distrinet

Professor Daelemans will provide an overview of the types of conversational agents (chatbots  dialogue systems) that are currently being developed and the state of the art in machine learning / deep learning based approaches (based on large language models). He will give an overview of the remaining problems (among others: finding good evaluation methods  portability to new domains and tasks  separating background knowledge from language knowledge  consistency in dialogue management  personalization  controling generation  reducing update time  ...)  focus on proposed solutions to those problems  and illustrate them using the vaccinchat.be chatbot he and his team have developed in 2021 to answer questions about vaccination. Speaker : Stephen Lernout  Head of Strategy & Innovation @ Nalantis Local city authorities have mountains of data  which only continue to grow as decisions are made on a monthly basis. This data overload makes it hard for city employees to quickly find and access the right information. At the same time  citizens have questions and expect quick responses from city personnel regarding topics from garbage disposal to parking and building regulations. This is extremely frustrating for both the city employees and the citizens. Nalantis' proprietary AI system uses natural language understanding to contextually understand City Council decisions in unstructured format (Text  Video and Audio) across multiple languages. The pre-trained NLU software extracts meaning from text through automatic semantic annotation at paragraph and sentence level.

This type of splitting arises when the datasets from different sources cannot be aggregated on one single machine or when the available machines are of different powers. A de-biased estimator of the precision matrix on every single machine is proposed  and theoretical guarantees are provided. Moreover  a new de-biased estimator that is pooled across the machines using a composite likelihood approach is proposed. It is shown to enjoy consistency and asymptotic normality  and we provide statistical inference strategies based on it. The performance of this estimator is investigated via simulation studies and real data exam- ples. It is shown that the performance of this estimator is close to the non-distributed estimator  which uses the entire dataset. 12:00–1:00 pmon-campus (KU Leuven Faculty of Economics and Business HOGM 01.85) or online via Zoom (https://us02web.zoom.us/j/88418552909?pwd=MERhSDAvSVdET0xKWnpFOUxHOVJMUT09)24 February 2022 Elia Lapenta (ENSAE Paris) “Nonparametric instrumental variable estimation without smoothing on the instruments”  We propose a new estimation method for nonparametric models identified by Instru- mental Variables (IVs). The estimation is based on a class of Generically Comprehensively Revealing functions. Compared to methods available in the literature that smooth on the IVs  our estimation does not smooth on the instruments and thus requires the selection of less tun- ing parameters. Furthermore  it does not suffer from a curse of dimensionality on the IVs. We show that our procedure is equivalent to a classical estimation method that smooths on the Ivs but keeps the bandwidth fixed as the sample size increases.  We then extend our methodology to estimate a partly linear model with endogenous variables. We obtain convergence rates for the estimator of the nonparametric part of the model and the asymptotic normality of the estimator of the parametric components. To deal with the ill- posedness of the inverse problem  we use a Landweber-Friedman regularization. This has the advantage of being a simple iterative method that avoids the inversion of a large matrix whose dimension increases with the sample size. We finally study the implementation of our proce- dure and propose a data-driven selection of the regularization and the smoothing parameters.

A clustering algorithm should be able  despite of this heterogene- ity  to extract discriminant pieces of information from the variables in order to design groups. In this work we introduce a multilayer architecture model-based clustering method called Mixed Deep Gaussian Mixture Model (MDGMM) that can be viewed as an automatic way to merge the clustering performed separately on continuous and non-continuous data. This architecture is flexible and can be adapted to mixed as well as to continuous or non-continuous data. In this sense we generalize Generalized Linear Latent Variable Models and Deep Gaussian Mixture Models. We also design a new initialisation strategy and a data driven method that selects the best specification of the model and the optimal number of clusters for a given dataset “on the fly”. Besides  our model provides continuous low-dimensional representations of the data which can be a useful tool to visualize mixed datasets. Finally  we validate the performance of our approach comparing its results with state-of-the-art mixed data clustering models over several commonly used datasets.12:00–1:00 pmonline10 March 2022 Cavit Pakel (Bilkent University) “Bounds on average effects in discrete choice panel data models”  Average effects in discrete choice panel data models with individual-specific fixed effects are generally only partially identified in short panels. While consistent estimation of the identified set is possible  it generally requires very large sample sizes  especially when the number of support points of the observed covariates is large  such as when the covariates are continuous. In this paper  we propose estimating outer bounds on the identified set of average effects. Our bounds are easy to construct  converge at the parametric rate  and are computationally simple to obtain even in moderately large samples  independent of whether the covariates are discrete or continuous. We also provide asymptotically valid confidence intervals on the identified set. Simulation studies confirm that our approach works well and is informative in finite samples. We also consider an application to labor force participation.

In addition  we use the bootstrap to generate plausible synthetic samples of data not seen in historical real data to create statistics of interest pertaining to uncertainty. While our approach is generic we focus on robust portfolio allocation problems as an application and study the impact of risk versus uncer- tainty in a dynamic mean-variance setting. We show that a mean-variance optimizing investor achieves economically meaningful wealth gains (33%) across our sample from 1996-2019 by internalizing our uncertainty measure during portfolio formation.

In this talk  we will address post-selection inference through approximate maximum likelihood estimation. Our goal is to: (i) efficiently utilize hold-out information from selection with the aid of randomization  (ii) bypass expensive MCMC sampling from exact conditional distri- butions that are hard to evaluate in closed forms. At the core of our new method is the solution to a convex optimization problem which assumes a separable form across multiple learning queries during selection. We illustrate the potential of our method across wide-ranging values of signal-to-noise ratio in simulated experiments. 12:00–1:00 pm  online31 March 2022 Limin Peng (Emory University) “Heterogeneous individual risk modeling of recurrent events”  Progression of chronic disease is often manifested by repeated occurrences of disease-related events over time. Delineating the heterogeneity in the risk of such recurrent events can provide valuable scientific insight for guiding customized disease management. In this paper  we propose a new sensible measure of individual risk of recurrent events and present a dynamic modeling framework thereof  which accounts for both observed covariates and unobservable frailty. The proposed modeling requires no distributional specification of the unobservable frailty  while permitting the exploration of dynamic effects of the observed covari- ates. We develop estimation and inference procedures for the proposed model through a novel adaptation of the principle of conditional score. The asymptotic properties of the proposed es- timator  including the uniform consistency and weak convergence  are established. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate satisfactory finite-sample performance of the proposed method. We illustrate the practical utility of the new method via an application to a diabetes clinical trial that explores the risk patterns of hypoglycemia in Type 2 diabetes patients. 5:00–6:00 pm  online21 April 2022 Angelo Guevara (Universidad de Chile) “Endogeneity in discrete choice models”  Endogeneity is the most severe failure that a discrete choice model can face in its objective of making causal inference or forecasting. It occurs when the explanatory variables are not independent of the error term and results in inconsistent estimators of the model pa- rameters. This seminar summarizes the causes  impact  and state of the art methods to detect and to address endogeneity in discrete choice models  which are related  but differ in relevant aspects  from those of linear model. The emphasis is put on providing the theoretical funda- mentals and the intuition behind the problems that may arise  as well as practical details as on how to apply the methods to address them  stressing the main considerations that must be taken in this endeavor. The main concepts are formally stated  and references are given to specific recent articles for further details that may be required for advanced applications or a deeper understanding. The seminar begins providing details on the definition  impact  causes and examples of endogeneity in discrete choice models  followed by a revision of possible approaches to detect this problem. Then  a deep review of the fundamentals  intuition and practicalities of the various methods that can be used to address endogeneity is presented  followed by a section providing insights and methods related to the obtention and validation of instrumental variables  which are key in this effort. The seminar continues then revising the problem of forecasting with discrete choice models that have been corrected for endogeneity  finalizing with a summary of the main conclusions and takeaways. 5:00–6:00 pmonline28 April 2022 Cécile Adam (KU Leuven) “Local linear functional mean regression under censoring”  Among the main interests in regression analysis is to explore the influence that a functional has on a real-valued variable of interest  the response. There is some literature on flexible mean regression  in which the targeted quantity is the conditional mean of the response given the functional. Another interest in statistics is to study the regression under the condition of censoring in which the values of the response are only partially known. After an introduc- tion to mean regression function estimation in which the response variable is subject to right random censorship  different statistical methodology are presented. The finite-sample perfor- mance of the estimators is investigated via a simulation study. (Joint work with I. Gijbels and G. Claeskens.) 12:00–1:00 pm  on campus 5 May 2022 Wiktor Budzinski (University of Warsaw) “Hybrid choice models vs. endogeneity of indicator variables: a Monte Carlo investigation”  We investigate the problem of endogeneity in the context of hybrid choice (integrated choice and latent variable) models. We first provide a thorough analysis of potential causes of endogeneity and propose a working taxonomy. We demonstrate that although it is widely believed that the hybrid choice framework is devoid of the endogeneity problem  there is no theoretical reason to expect that this is the case. We then demonstrate empirically that the problem exists in the hybrid choice framework too. By conducting a Monte Carlo experiment  we display the extent of the bias resulting from measurement and endogeneity biases. Finally  we propose two novel solutions to address the problem: by explicitly accounting for correlation between structural and discrete choice component error terms (or with random parameters in a utility function)  or by introducing additional latent variables. Using simulated data  we demonstrate that these approaches work as expected  that is  they result in unbiased estimates of all model parameters. 12:00–1:00 pm online12 May 2022 Wendun Wang (Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam) “Recovering spillover structures with structural breaks in panel data models”  This paper aims at capturing time-varying spillover effects in a panel data setting. We consider panel models where the outcome of a unit not only depends on own characteristics and also the characteristics of other units (spillover effects). The effect of own characteristics can be unit-specific or homogeneous (common effects). We allow the spillover structure  i.e.  which units interact with which  to be latent  and the structure and effect of spillovers may both vary over time. We model time-varying spillovers via structural breaks with unknown break points. To estimate the break points  spillover and common effects  we solve a penalized least squares optimization and employ double machine learning procedures to improve the conver- gence and inference. We establish the super consistency of the estimated break point and provide the convergence rate of estimated spillover and common effects. We illustrate the theory via simulated and empirical data. 12:00–1:00 pm on-campus19 May 2022 Thierry Magnac (Toulouse School of Economics) “Linear models with interval-censored explanatory variables”  This paper studies the problem of inference in a set identified problem defined by linear moment restrictions with interval-censored variables. It introduces a novel and tractable inference procedure based on characterizing the identified set of the coefficient of interest in terms of the solution to convex optimization problems with equality constraints. Monte Carlo experiments evaluate the numerical performance of the novel inference procedure and compare it with existing ones.12:00–1:00 pm on-campus "|Statistics and Econometrics Seminars  17

consistent estimation of the identified set is possible  it generally requires very large sample sizes  especially when the number of support points of the observed covariates is large  such as when the covariates are continuous In this paper  we propose estimating outer bounds on the identified set of average effects Our bounds are easy to construct  converge at the parametric rate  and are computationally simple to obtain even in moderately large samples  independent of whether the covariates are discrete or continuous We also provide asymptotically valid confidence intervals on the identified set Simulation studies confirm that our approach works well and is informative in finite samples We also consider an application to labor force participation Joint work with Martin Weidner

learning to impose guidance and dis cipline on the formulation of expectations in a datarich environment In addition  we use the bootstrap to generate plausible synthetic samples of data not seen in historical real data to create statistics of interest pertaining to uncertainty While our approach is generic we focus on robust portfolio allocation problems as an application and study the impact of risk versus uncer tainty in a dynamic meanvariance setting We show that a meanvariance optimizing investor achieves economically meaningful wealth gains 33 across our sample from 19962019 by

University Michigan “Approximate selective inference via maximum likelihood”  Several strategies have been developed recently to ensure valid inferences after model selection some of these are easy to compute  while others fare better in terms of inferen tial power In this talk  we will address postselection inference through approximate maximum likelihood estimation Our goal is to i efficiently utilize holdout information from selection with the aid of randomization  ii bypass expensive MCMC sampling from exact conditional distri butions that are hard to evaluate in closed forms At the core of our new method is the solution to a convex optimization problem which assumes a separable form across multiple learning queries during selection We illustrate the potential of our method across wideranging values of signaltonoise ratio in simulated experiments 1200–100 pm  online31 March 2022 Limin Peng Emory University “Heterogeneous individual risk modeling of recurrent events”  Progression of chronic disease is often manifested by repeated occurrences of diseaserelated events over time Delineating the heterogeneity in the risk of such recurrent events can provide valuable scientific insight for guiding customized disease management In this paper  we propose a new sensible measure of individual risk of recurrent events and present a dynamic modeling framework thereof  which accounts for both observed covariates and unobservable frailty The proposed modeling requires no distributional specification of the unobservable frailty  while permitting the exploration of dynamic effects of the observed covari ates We develop estimation and inference procedures for the proposed model through a novel adaptation of the principle of conditional score The asymptotic properties of the proposed es timator  including the uniform consistency and weak convergence  are established Extensive simulation studies demonstrate satisfactory finitesample performance of the proposed method We illustrate the practical utility of the new method via an application to a diabetes clinical trial that explores the risk patterns of hypoglycemia in Type 2 diabetes patients

objective of making causal inference or forecasting It occurs when the explanatory variables are not independent of the error term and results in inconsistent estimators of the model pa rameters This seminar summarizes the causes  impact  and state of the art methods to detect and to address endogeneity in discrete choice models  which are related  but differ in relevant aspects  from those of linear model The emphasis is put on providing the theoretical funda mentals and the intuition behind the problems that may arise  as well as practical details as on how to apply the methods to address them  stressing the main considerations that must be taken in this endeavor The main concepts are formally stated  and references are given to specific recent articles for further details that may be required for advanced applications or a deeper understanding The seminar begins providing details on the definition  impact  causes and examples of endogeneity in discrete choice models  followed by a revision of possible approaches to detect this problem Then  a deep review of the fundamentals  intuition and practicalities of the various methods that can be used to address endogeneity is presented  followed by a section providing insights and methods related to the obtention and validation of instrumental variables  which are key in this effort The seminar continues then revising the problem of forecasting with discrete choice models that have been corrected for endogeneity  finalizing with a summary of the main conclusions and takeaways 500–600 pmonline28 April 2022 Cécile Adam KU Leuven “Local linear functional mean regression under censoring”  Among the main interests in regression analysis is to explore the influence that a functional has on a realvalued variable of interest  the response There is some literature on flexible mean regression  in which the targeted quantity is the conditional mean of the response given the functional Another interest in statistics is to study the regression under the condition of censoring in which the values of the response are only partially known After an introduc tion to mean regression function estimation in which the response variable is subject to right random censorship  different statistical methodology are presented The finitesample perfor mance of the estimators is investigated via a simulation study Joint work with I Gijbels and G Claeskens 1200–100 pm  on campus 5 May 2022 Wiktor Budzinski University of Warsaw “Hybrid choice models vs endogeneity of indicator variables a Monte Carlo investigation”  We investigate the problem of endogeneity in the context of hybrid choice integrated choice and latent variable models We first provide a thorough analysis of potential causes of endogeneity and propose a working taxonomy We demonstrate that although it is widely believed that the hybrid choice framework is devoid of the endogeneity problem  there is no theoretical reason to expect that this is the case We then demonstrate empirically that the problem exists in the hybrid choice framework too By conducting a Monte Carlo experiment  we display the extent of the bias resulting from measurement and endogeneity biases Finally  we propose two novel solutions to address the problem by explicitly accounting for correlation between structural and discrete choice component error terms or with random parameters in a utility function  or by introducing additional latent variables Using simulated data  we demonstrate that these approaches work as expected  that is  they result in unbiased estimates of all model parameters 1200–100 pm online12 May 2022 Wendun Wang Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam “Recovering spillover structures with structural breaks in panel data models”  This paper aims at capturing timevarying spillover effects in a panel data setting We consider panel models where the outcome of a unit not only depends on own characteristics and also the characteristics of other units spillover effects The effect of own characteristics can be unitspecific or homogeneous common effects We allow the spillover structure  ie  which units interact with which  to be latent  and the structure and effect of spillovers may both vary over time We model timevarying spillovers via structural breaks with unknown break points To estimate the break points  spillover and common effects  we solve a penalized least squares optimization and employ double machine learning procedures to improve the conver gence and inference We establish the super consistency of the estimated break point and provide the convergence rate of estimated spillover and common effects We illustrate the theory via simulated and empirical data 1200–100 pm oncampus19 May 2022 Thierry Magnac Toulouse School of Economics “Linear models with intervalcensored explanatory variables”  This paper studies the problem of inference in a set identified problem defined by linear moment restrictions with

We  humans  will know for sure when we encounter one in the wild  but machines can nowadays make an excellent guess too. With more than 99.5% accuracy  modern machine learning algorithms know very well how to exploit visual features as best as possible. But  alas  that is not the complete picture: machines are easily fooled too. With some clever tricks  any picture of a lion can easily be manipulated in such a way that humans do not notice any difference  but that the machine learning model sees a completely different animal. Such a manipulated image is called an adversarial example.What is going on there? Have we built the most powerful machine learning models ever on brittle foundations?  The above is an example of adversarial learning  a subfield of machine learning that is concerned with what happens when we fool a machine learning model and how we can prevent and/or exploit this. While the first example here is mostly concerned with issues  an example of exploitation is found in the class of machine learning models called generative adversarial networks. Ever since the dawn of generative adversarial networks  the field of generative machine learning has taken multiple leaps forward and has paved the way to application domains we couldn’t even think of before. When training generative adversarial networks  we let two machines play a game against each other: one machine gradually tries to become a master painter  while the other machine is the art critic that gets better and better at discerning genuine paintings from counterfeits. By making the painter try to fool the critic over and over again  the painter becomes more skilled and will produce more realistic paintings. |Adversarial Machine Learning  How can you tell the difference between elephants and lions We  humans  will know for sure when we encounter one in the wild  but machines can nowadays make an excellent guess too With more than 995 accuracy  modern machine learning algorithms know very well how to exploit visual features as best as possible But  alas  that is not the complete picture machines are easily fooled too With some clever tricks  any picture of a lion can easily be manipulated in such a way that humans do not notice any difference  but that the machine learning model sees a completely different animal Such a manipulated image is called an adversarial exampleWhat is going on there Have we built the most powerful machine learning models ever on brittle foundations  The above is an example of adversarial learning  a subfield of machine learning that is concerned with what happens when we fool a machine learning model and how we can prevent andor exploit this While the first example here is mostly concerned with issues  an example of exploitation is found in the class of machine learning models called generative adversarial networks Ever since the dawn of generative adversarial networks  the field of generative machine learning has taken multiple leaps forward and has paved the way to application domains we couldn’t even think of before When training generative adversarial networks  we let two machines play a game against each other one machine gradually tries to become a master painter  while the other machine is the art critic that gets better and better at discerning genuine paintings from counterfeits By making the painter try to fool the critic over and over again  the painter becomes more skilled and will produce more realistic paintings  More info  Share this course   httpswwwvaiabeencoursesadversarialmachinelearning 1 Dec 2021  3 Dec 2021 masterclassUGent UGain

Within the safety & security domain  it is a  challenge to inform individuals and organizations working together  around a common problem in such a way that activities can be developed. This means that sufficient information must be present to coordinate  activities  while access to information must be possible within the  network. Without these two conditions  it is impossible to address a  security threat or coordinate a crisis.  Those challenges create several issues regarding the coordination of  information  the integration of technology within and between  organizations and networks  the use of Generative Artificial  Intelligence to achieve better decision-making  etc. In this lecture   Mr. Chaara elaborates on these issues and tries to answer the challenges  posed.

Description This course aims to provide insight into basic statistical concepts with emphasis on practical applications. Mathematical formulae will be kept to a minimum. The theory and the methods of analysis will be extensively illustrated with examples relating to a wide variety of different fields. To emphasize the practical approach in this course all classes will take place in a pc room. The practical part of the first session (after the break) will be dedicated to getting to know the software package R. Participants are encouraged to participate in both parts. We start with concise graphical and numerical descriptions of data obtained from observational or experimental studies. The most common and frequently used probability distributions of discrete and continuous variables will be presented. Statistical inference draws conclusions about a population based on sampled data. Chance variations are taken into account such that a level of confidence is attached to these conclusions. We present the reasoning behind significance tests for the comparison of observed data with a hypothesis  the validity of which we want to assess. We apply this procedure to data obtained either from one or from two populations. The correct use of the t-test will be discussed. Nonparametric methods are considered as a possible alternative in case the requirements of the t-test are not met. We cover the basic concepts of hypothesis testing for categorical data  including the chi-square test. Quite often the relationship between two variables  where the outcome of one variable is seen as depending on the value of the other  is the focus of scientific interest. We will give an introduction to linear regression analysis  where a regression line based on observations obtained in a sample describes this relation. Hands-on exercises are worked out behind the PC using the R software. Target audience This course will benefit professionals and investigators from diverse areas  research scientists  clinical research associates  investing in data handling and wishing to acquire insight into basic statistical methods or to refresh their knowledge and practice of statistics. Fees The participation fee is 1320 EUR for participants from the private sector. Reduced prices apply to students and staff from non-profit  social profit  and government organizations. An exam fee of 35 EUR will be applied.

Especially  we do not fully understand how ethical perceptions about AI influence both job applicants and the organizations that use AI for hiring purposes. In this session  we will discuss important aspects of using AI in hiring processes. First  we will discuss that AI is not created equally in terms of ethical perceptions. Indeed  people view the use of AI differently depending on what aspects of the hiring process it is used for (e.g.  analyzing CV vs. analyzing one’s social media). Then  we will discuss the influence of ethical perceptions of AI in hiring on the trust individuals put in organizations that use AI in hiring. We will focus on the importance individuals lend to AI performing its expected role  and how this expectation influences their ethical perceptions of AI  and in turn the trust they put on organizations using AI in hiring. Finally  we will further discuss whether and how ethical perceptions of using AI in hiring are related to individuals’ attraction to organizations that use AI in hiring. Circling back to the beginning of the session  we will discuss that the influence of ethical perceptions of using AI in hiring are not consistent across hiring methods. For example  only individuals who consider it ethical for organizations to use AI in intrusive ways  such as analyzing social media information for traits and characteristics  viewed such organizations as more attractive. |Ethical Perceptions of AI How Does it Matter for Hiring  Abstract of the lecture  The use of Artificial Intelligence AI entails enormous ethical challenges Especially  we do not fully understand how ethical perceptions about AI influence both job applicants and the organizations that use AI for hiring purposes In this session  we will discuss important aspects of using AI in hiring processes First  we will discuss that AI is not created equally in terms of ethical perceptions Indeed  people view the use of AI differently depending on what aspects of the hiring process it is used for eg  analyzing CV vs analyzing one’s social media Then  we will discuss the influence of ethical perceptions of AI in hiring on the trust individuals put in organizations that use AI in hiring We will focus on the importance individuals lend to AI performing its expected role  and how this expectation influences their ethical perceptions of AI  and in turn the trust they put on organizations using AI in hiring Finally  we will further discuss whether and how ethical perceptions of using AI in hiring are related to individuals’ attraction to organizations that use AI in hiring Circling back to the beginning of the session  we will discuss that the influence of ethical perceptions of using AI in hiring are not consistent across hiring methods For example  only individuals who consider it ethical for organizations to use AI in intrusive ways  such as analyzing social media information for traits and characteristics  viewed such organizations as more attractive  More info  Share this course   httpswwwvubbeeneventethicalperceptionsaihowdoesitmatterforhiring 26 Oct 2023 1400  1600 LectureBrusselVUB

Description R is a flexible environment for statistical computing and graphics  which is becoming increasingly popular as a tool to get insight in often complex data. While in some ways similar to other programming languages (such as C  Java and Perl)  R is particularly suited for data analysis because ready-made functions are available for a wide variety of statistical (classical statistical tests  linear and nonlinear modeling  timeseries analysis  classification  clustering  ...) and graphical techniques. The base R program can be extended with user-submitted packages  which means new techniques are often implemented in R before being available in other software. This is one of the reasons why R is becoming the de facto standard in certain fields such as bioinformatics (Bioconductor) and financial services. This course introduces the use of the R environment for the implementation of data management  data exploration  basic statistical analysis and automation of procedures. It starts with a description of the R GUI  the use of the command line and an overview of basic data structures. The application of standard procedures to import data or to export results to external files will be illustrated. Creation of new variables  subsetting  merging and stacking of data sets will be covered in the data management section. Exploration of the data by histograms  box plots  scatter plots  summary numbers  correlation coefficients and cross-tabulations will be performed. Simple statistical procedures that will be covered are: comparisons of observed group means (t-test  ANOVA and their non-parametric versions) and proportionstest for independence in 2-way cross tables and linear regression (focusing on the R-implementation of the statistical methods that are the subject of other modules of the statistics series)Finally  installing new packages and automation of analysis procedures will also be discussed. Practical sessions and specific exercises will be provided to allow participants to practice their R skills in interaction with the teacher. Target audience This course targets professionals and investigators from diverse areas with little to no R-programming experience who wish to start using R for their data manipulation  data exploration or statistical analysis.

However  these generative AI systems raise many ethical  epistemological  anthropological  psychological  economic  social  political and cultural questions. Some of these issues will continue to occur as these technologies are put to new uses  and it is not yet possible to predict all the effects they will have on individuals and society. Since the end of 2022  economic and political actors in several countries are discussing the impact of language models built with these generative AI systems. Some of these models have an impressive number of parameters. The race for the largest model is ongoing  but it is not certain that larger models would deliver higher performance. Laurence Devillers was involved as a co-writer of the opinion n°7 of the ethical issues of generative artificial intelligence in the CNPEN (National Pilot Committee for Digital Ethics). In this opinion  CNPEN focuses on the most important ethical issues in the light of current experience with generative AI systems  mainly on language models. |Ethical Issues of Generative AI  The social and economic impact of generative AI systems is likely to be major in many potential uses  for example in the environment or in healthcare However  these generative AI systems raise many ethical  epistemological  anthropological  psychological  economic  social  political and cultural questions Some of these issues will continue to occur as these technologies are put to new uses  and it is not yet possible to predict all the effects they will have on individuals and society Since the end of 2022  economic and political actors in several countries are discussing the impact of language models built with these generative AI systems Some of these models have an impressive number of parameters The race for the largest model is ongoing  but it is not certain that larger models would deliver higher performance Laurence Devillers was involved as a cowriter of the opinion n°7 of the ethical issues of generative artificial intelligence in the CNPEN National Pilot Committee for Digital Ethics In this opinion  CNPEN focuses on the most important ethical issues in the light of current experience with generative AI systems  mainly on language models  More info  Share this course   httpsdocsgooglecomformsde1FAIpQLScuYIQJpAnAvtUPNpHTotIuNFbeNLS1mV5dMlyDecEUx0FZQviewform 18 Oct 2023 1100  1200 lectureonlineCLARINBE

Corless|The name “Bohemian matrices” was proposed for a field that has actually been studied for many years now by different researchers, not recognizing their commonality. The name comes from an acronym for BOunded HEight Matrices, of Integers, although the restriction to integers has been subsequently relaxed.| The name “Bohemian matrices” was proposed for a field that has actually been studied for many years now by different researchers  not recognizing their commonality. The name comes from an acronym for BOunded HEight Matrices  of Integers  although the restriction to integers has been subsequently relaxed. The “height” of a vector is its infinity norm  and the “height” of a matrix A is the infinity norm of vec(A). The word “height” has been commonly used in the context of univariate polynomials expressed in the monomial basis: the height of a polynomial is the infinity norm of the vector of coefficients. We say “characteristic height” for the height of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix A. The idea is to restrict the study to families of matrices all of whose entries come from a finite (and hence bounded) set  called the population. Well-known examples include zero-one or binary matrices  Bernoulli matrices whose entries are either 1 or -1  and sign pattern matrices where the entries can be 1  0  or -1. One can then study Bohemian families of structured matrices  say upper Hessenberg Toeplitz Bohemian matrices  or complex symmetric tridiagonal Bohemian matrices  or symmetric matrices with entries from a restricted population  or Bohemian companion matrices  or other families. In this talk I will survey some known results  and discuss some problems that remain open. In particular  I will ask for help in finding algorithms to construct “minimal height” companion matrices for polynomials with integer coefficients; such things exist (possibly not uniquely) but there is no known good algorithm for constructing them. I will give examples where the height of the companion matrix is exponentially smaller (in the degree/dimension) than is the characteristic height. This seems interesting because lower height offers the hope of better eigenvalue conditioning. But even that is not well-understood. This is joint work with many people. |Bohemian Matrices An introduction and some open problems  The name “Bohemian matrices” was proposed for a field that has actually been studied for many years now by different researchers  not recognizing their commonality The name comes from an acronym for BOunded HEight Matrices  of Integers  although the restriction to integers has been subsequently relaxed The “height” of a vector is its infinity norm  and the “height” of a matrix A is the infinity norm of vecA The word “height” has been commonly used in the context of univariate polynomials expressed in the monomial basis the height of a polynomial is the infinity norm of the vector of coefficients We say “characteristic height” for the height of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix A The idea is to restrict the study to families of matrices all of whose entries come from a finite and hence bounded set  called the population Wellknown examples include zeroone or binary matrices  Bernoulli matrices whose entries are either 1 or 1  and sign pattern matrices where the entries can be 1  0  or 1 One can then study Bohemian families of structured matrices  say upper Hessenberg Toeplitz Bohemian matrices  or complex symmetric tridiagonal Bohemian matrices  or symmetric matrices with entries from a restricted population  or Bohemian companion matrices  or other families In this talk I will survey some known results  and discuss some problems that remain open In particular  I will ask for help in finding algorithms to construct “minimal height” companion matrices for polynomials with integer coefficients such things exist possibly not uniquely but there is no known good algorithm for constructing them I will give examples where the height of the companion matrix is exponentially smaller in the degreedimension than is the characteristic height This seems interesting because lower height offers the hope of better eigenvalue conditioning But even that is not wellunderstood This is joint work with many people  The name “Bohemian matrices” was proposed for a field that has actually been studied for many years now by different researchers not recognizing their commonality The name comes from an acronym for BOunded HEight Matrices of Integers although the restriction to integers has been subsequently relaxed httpshomesesatkuleuvenbesistawwwbdmbacktotherootsindexphpseminars Seminar by Robert M Corless seminarHeverlee LeuvenKU Leuven ESAT STADIUS

Professionals in this domain, however, might struggle to keep up with the fast-paced developments in recent years. In particular, the recent and impressive emergence of neural networks in machine learning as a go-to paradigm has rapidly altered the state of the art in artificial intelligence and challenges existing computational approaches to text. This micro-credential has been carved out as a balanced selection of contemporary modules from the MA in Digital Text Analysis that targets industry professionals who are interested in learning about modern machine learning and natural language processing. With an emphasis on project and teamwork, we develop practical applications on textual data, as well as solutions for the many issues that remain open in the field.| This micro-credential focuses on the following learning outcomes. 1. The participant will have theoretical knowledge about the history and the main frameworks of Machine Learning. 2. The participant will have theoretical knowledge of the main machine learning algorithms and paradigms and will study some of them in depth. 3. The participant will be able to develop machine learning pipelines and set up their own machine learning experiments using Python modules. 4. The participant will have theoretical and practical knowledge of machine learning using neural networks. 5. The participant will understand the fundamental problems and approaches in automatic Natural Language Processing and know its history as a subfield within Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence. 6. The participant will have insight into the basic algorithms developed within NLP for morphological  syntactic  semantic  and discourse processing. 7. The participant will acquire hands-on experience with software for text categorization  language understanding  translation  and generation. This micro-credential is a targeted subset from the MA in Digital Text Analysis and singles a teaching track in natural language processing. None of the modules overlap in time  allowing students to engage at a reasonable pace  over the course of the first and second semester. All courses extensively rely on weekly  hands-on homework assignments  ensuring the acquisition of new  practical insights on a regular basis. The homework takes the form of engaging assignments on real-world datasets that challenge the students to apply the theoretical concept introduced during the interactive class sessions.The final evaluation of all three courses depends on project work  the goal and finality of which can be determined by the individual students  in close correspondence with the course teachers.An attractive feature of the evaluation of the NLP course (in the 2nd semester) is that students will participate in an ongoing shared task in the field. This micro-credential focuses on the following learning outcomes. 1. The participant will have theoretical knowledge about the history and the main frameworks of Machine Learning. 2. The participant will have theoretical knowledge of the main machine learning algorithms and paradigms and will study some of them in depth. 3. The participant will be able to develop machine learning pipelines and set up their own machine learning experiments using Python modules. 4. The participant will have theoretical and practical knowledge of machine learning using neural networks. 5. The participant will understand the fundamental problems and approaches in automatic Natural Language Processing and know its history as a subfield within Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence. 6. The participant will have insight into the basic algorithms developed within NLP for morphological  syntactic  semantic  and discourse processing. 7. The participant will acquire hands-on experience with software for text categorization  language understanding  translation  and generation. |Machine Learning of Natural Language Processing  This microcredential focuses on the following learning outcomes 1 The participant will have theoretical knowledge about the history and the main frameworks of Machine Learning 2 The participant will have theoretical knowledge of the main machine learning algorithms and paradigms and will study some of them in depth 3 The participant will be able to develop machine learning pipelines and set up their own machine learning experiments using Python modules 4 The participant will have theoretical and practical knowledge of machine learning using neural networks 5 The participant will understand the fundamental problems and approaches in automatic Natural Language Processing and know its history as a subfield within Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence 6 The participant will have insight into the basic algorithms developed within NLP for morphological  syntactic  semantic  and discourse processing 7 The participant will acquire handson experience with software for text categorization  language understanding  translation  and generation This microcredential is a targeted subset from the MA in Digital Text Analysis and singles a teaching track in natural language processing None of the modules overlap in time  allowing students to engage at a reasonable pace  over the course of the first and second semester All courses extensively rely on weekly  handson homework assignments  ensuring the acquisition of new  practical insights on a regular basis The homework takes the form of engaging assignments on realworld datasets that challenge the students to apply the theoretical concept introduced during the interactive class sessionsThe final evaluation of all three courses depends on project work  the goal and finality of which can be determined by the individual students  in close correspondence with the course teachersAn attractive feature of the evaluation of the NLP course in the 2nd semester is that students will participate in an ongoing shared task in the field This microcredential focuses on the following learning outcomes 1 The participant will have theoretical knowledge about the history and the main frameworks of Machine Learning 2 The participant will have theoretical knowledge of the main machine learning algorithms and paradigms and will study some of them in depth 3 The participant will be able to develop machine learning pipelines and set up their own machine learning experiments using Python modules 4 The participant will have theoretical and practical knowledge of machine learning using neural networks 5 The participant will understand the fundamental problems and approaches in automatic Natural Language Processing and know its history as a subfield within Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence 6 The participant will have insight into the basic algorithms developed within NLP for morphological  syntactic  semantic  and discourse processing 7 The participant will acquire handson experience with software for text categorization  language understanding  translation  and generation  Natural Language Processing is an integral component to applications of data science across the technological industry nowadays Professionals in this domain however might struggle to keep up with the fastpaced developments in recent years In particular the recent and impressive emergence of neural networks in machine learning as a goto paradigm has rapidly altered the state of the art in artificial intelligence and challenges existing computational approaches to text This microcredential has been carved out as a balanced selection of contemporary modules from the MA in Digital Text Analysis that targets industry professionals who are interested in learning about modern machine learning and natural language processing With an emphasis on project and teamwork we develop practical applications on textual data as well as solutions for the many issues that remain open in the field httpswwwuantwerpenbeenstudyprogrammesallprogrammesmachinelearningofnlpenrol Ignite your skills in artificial intelligence for language technology​​ Microcredential 12 ECTSAntwerpUAntwerp

Authors of accepted abstracts will have the opportunity to submit a full paper after the conference to CLIN Journal. CLIN33 organizes a shared task on the Automatic Detection of AI-Generated Texts. With the surge of powerful automatic content generation comes the important task of distinguishing texts generated by language models from texts written by humans. Therefore  the CLIN33 shared task invites you to contribute to the development of automatic detection systems of AI-generated texts. The shared task consists of two tracks.  Visit the shared task website for more information Detection Track In this track you will develop a system that detects whether a document is generated by a language model or written by a human. The system will be evaluated on a test dataset that will remain hidden. For tuning your system you will be provided with a sample of the test data as a development set. Your system will be submitted as a notebook (colab or jupyter) and be self-containedThe test data will not be sharedYou will be provided with a subset of the test data for validation and developmentNo training data will be provided  you are expected to create your own when using Machine LearningThere will be a scoreboard for testing your model on the validation data that you can use to monitor progress during developmentThere will be three genres of text: newspaper text  tweets  and poemsThe text will be generated by different language models (we will provide information about which models later)The generated text will be produced using different prompt engineering strategies (standard  academic level  middle school level  human-like  ...)There will be an English and a Dutch subtrack. Participants are expected to participate in both. There will be a prize for the team that develops the best performing system averaged over both languages and all conditions. Explanation Track (optional) In this track  you will provide a qualitative analysis  empirically supported by the output of your system on the validation set  of the knowledge used by your model to solve the task. This explanation can be in terms of statistical properties or in terms of linguistic patterns and phenomena and will the form of a short paper (4 pages max). This track will be evaluated by the organizers  extended with additional judges representing the users of detection systems (for example teachers or editors).

Over 56% of the world population now lives in cities  and this number can go as high as 97% in Belgium. In parallel  technology plays an increasingly important role in these environments. Specifically: Artificial intelligence  Data  and Robotics have become an integral part of living in cities. We may not always be aware of their presence  but they are playing a critical role in our daily commutes  government services  local stores  or in the public space. Concepts such as ""smart cities"" have emerged and reflect the continuing desire of cities to implement these technologies on a large scale to address local challenges - one of which is  of course  becoming even more sustainable. AI and data are now being actively used in a variety of areas  from energy sharing to biodiversity monitoring. Despite these hopes  growing concerns have emerged about the overall inhibiting impact of these technologies on sustainability. In addition  ethical and legal concerns have emerged  to the point where cities enact local responsible use principles  also insisting on greater citizen inclusion. This conference will investigate if and how AI  Data  and Robotics  can become local and are truly sustainable for cities. The FARI Brussels Conference agenda is continuously being updated and improved to give you the best and most insightful conference experience.

TUESDAY | Handwritten Text Recognition Transkribus  TEI-XML On the second day  we will recap what we have learned about HTR  and we will focus more specifically on the workflow in Transkribus. Then  we will do a creative exercise: writing a short story by hand. This will be the material to work with during the day as we will run the HTR model to 'transcribe' your own handwriting. In the end  we will export the results in TEI-XML. WEDNESDAY | Keystroke Logging Inputlog  keystroke logging  TEI-XML On the third day  we will build upon the creative exercise of Tuesday: we will revise the short story on the computer and logging the writing process with a keystroke logger. We will then use these keystroke logging files to learn the basic technologies involved in making a (genetic) digital edition. As a first step  we will encode all the textual operations (e.g.  new text production  additions  deletions) in TEI-XML together with the timestamps of each operation. These XML files will be used the next day as we move on to the visualisation of the reconstructions of the digital writing processes. THURSDAY | eXist-db eXist-db app  HTML  CSS On the fourth day  we will learn the basics of working with eXist-db. After jointly installing eXist-db  we will use a pre-made eXist-db application  which can visualise the keystroke logging transcription. In the afternoon we will visit a museum.

Thus  one can use DNN for image processing  actions recognition  text classification  language processing  speech recognition  etc. However  this high success of DNN models is accompanied by a high increase of computation time  architecture complexity  and memory storage. Moreover  the deployment and exploitation of DNN models in real environments is generally related to connected sensors (cameras  microphones  temperature sensors  etc.) where the inference process needs to be executed in real time on embedded or edge resources. In this work  we present an overview of the three main compression methods (pruning  quantization  knowledge distillation) that allow to reduce the computation time and memory size of DNN models while keeping a high accuracy. Experimental results are conducted within image classification  object detection and actions recognition with DNN models that were optimized and deployed on Edge AI resources such as Jetson Nano  Jetson Xavier and Jetson Orin. The obtained results showed that we could reach a compression factor of around 6x while keeping a good accuracy  and we also observe a speedup of 3x compared to non-compressed models.

It is meant to provide a place for the discussion of the most recent developments in optimisation in machine learning problems, and the exploration of new research directions in this field.| 13:00 - 13:40 Optimization of macro-at-k metrics in multi-label classification(Prof. dr. Krzysztof Dembczyński — Yahoo! Research  USA aned Poznań University of Technology  Poland) We consider a problem of optimizing macro-averaged complex performance metrics in multi-label classification  that is metrics linearly decomposable into a sum of binary classification utilities applied separately to each label. We focus on tasks in which the algorithm is required to predict exactly k labels for each instance  leading to macro-at-k metrics. The constraint couples the otherwise independent binary classification tasks  leading to a much more challenging optimization problem than standard macro-averages. We analyze the problem in two different statistical regimes  namely in the expected test utility (ETU) and the population utility (PU) frameworks. The former aims at optimizing the expected performance on a given test set  while the latter optimizes the performance on a population level. For both frameworks we derive optimal prediction rules and practical algorithmic solutions with provable statistical guarantees. Empirical results provide evidence for the competitive performance of the proposed approaches.   13:40 - 14:20 On extensions of loss minimisation for training uncertainty-aware predictors (Prof. dr. Eyke Hüllermeier — LMU Munich  Germany) Due to the steadily increasing relevance of machine learning for practical applications  many of which are coming with safety requirements  the notion of uncertainty has received increasing attention in machine learning research in the recent past. This talk will address questions and challenges regarding the representation and adequate handling of (predictive) uncertainty in (supervised) machine learning. A specific focus will be put on the distinction between two important types of uncertainty  often referred to as aleatoric and epistemic. In this regard  a recent generalisation of the common (empirical) loss minimisation approach in machine learning will be critically anaysed and shown to be fundamentally flawed.   14:20 - 15:00 Learning from user and environment in combinatorial optimisation (Prof. dr. ir. Tias Guns — KU Leuven  Belgium) Industry and society are increasingly automating processes  which requires solving combinatorial optimisation problems. To find not just optimal solutions  but also 'desirable' solutions for the end user  it is increasingly important to offer AI tools that automatically learn from the user and the environment and that support the constraint modelling in interpretable ways. In this talk I will provide an overview of three different ways in which AI can augment the modeling part of combinatorial optimisation. This includes learning from the user (preference learning in VRP)  learning from the environment (end-to-end decision focussed learning) and explanation generation  that sit at the intersection of learning and reasoning. As part of this work  we are building a modern constraint programming language called CPMpy(http://cpmpy.readthedocs.io) that eases integration of multiple constraint solving paradigms with machine learning and other scientific python libraries. I will shortly highlight its possibilities beyond the above cases  as well as our larger vision of conversational human-aware technology for optimisation.   16:00 - 18:00 Efficient algorithms for set-valued prediction in classification (Public PhD defence ir. Thomas Mortier — Ghent University)  In recent years  the use of machine learning has gained popularity in solving complex tasks across multiple domains  including robotics  healthcare  biology and finance. However  with the increasing amount of data and complexity of tasks  the notion of uncertainty has become of major importance in machine learning. The ability to represent uncertainty in an efficient and trustworthy way should therefore be considered as a key feature of any machine learning method. This thesis aims to address this challenge by focusing on the development of principled tools to efficiently represent uncertainty in machine learning. In particular  the concept of set-valued prediction is highlighted  which provides end-users with multiple answers instead of a single answer with little guarantee. To this end  probabilistic classification is considered  where the unknown relationship between inputs and classes is assumed to be non-deterministic and expressed by a conditional class distribution. A distinction between several settings in classification is made and different biological applications are considered  including large-scale bacterial species identification using Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) data. |Optimisation in Machine Learning  1300  1340 Optimization of macroatk metrics in multilabel classificationProf dr
