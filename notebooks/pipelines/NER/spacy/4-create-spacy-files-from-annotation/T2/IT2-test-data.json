        "Mixed feedback systems  Eventbased technology is developing at a fast pace eg via  neuromorphic computing and eventbased cameras but we currently lack a  control theory of eventbased systems The general aim is to conceive  physical machines that combine the reliability of discrete automata and  the robustness and adaptation of physical control systems The theory of mixed feedback systems aims at leveraging the existing  theory of control  optimization  and learning while acknowledging the  inherent outofequilibrium nature of eventbased machines The theory is grounded in the operatortheoretic framework of maximal  monotonicity in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces The course will  introduce those mathematical tools at a basic level and present how they  can be used to analyze and design neuromorphic eventbased machines The course consists of six sessions over three days Each session will cover one of the following modules Module1 Feedback and memory RS 11 Examples of mixed feedback systems Motivation Current  limitations of control theory  machine learning  and neuromorphic  engineering 12 Static mixed feedback 13 Dynamic mixed feedback Questions and challenges Module 2 Feedback system analysis TC 21 Systems as operators Phase and Gain Monotonicity and Lipschitz operators The passivity and the smallgain theorems 22 Graphical representations Nyquist plots Scaled Relative Graphs 23 Mixed feedback systems Mixed gain and mixed phase feedback systems Module 3 Feedback algorithms TC 31 Fixed point algorithms and zero finding algorithms 32 Splitting algorithms and circuit representations 33 Algorithmic solutions of mixed feedback systems Module 4 Modelling at scale RS 41 Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces 42 Gradient systems in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces 43 Feedback neural networks at scale Module 5 Tuning at scale RS 51 Recursive least square estimation 52 A robust internal model principle for mixed feedback systems 53 Adaptive control and online learning at scale Module 6 Neuromorphic control RS 61 Physical Spiking Neural Networks 62 Control as neuromodulation at scale 63 Neuromorphic eventbased machines Course material  Slides  exercises  and references will be available  Evaluation  An assignment that will be released during the course  The SOCN Graduate School gathers Belgian teams UAntwerp  UNamur  KUL  UCLouvain  UGent  ULB  ULg  UMONS  VUB active in the area of Systems  Optimization  Control and Networks  or have strong interest in topics related to it The main objective of the Graduate School is to provide a high quality scientific environment and a wellbalanced graduatelevel program for the Belgian doctoral students in Systems  Optimization  Control and Networks A common research theme pursued by the participating teams consists in the modelling of certain systems and phenomena with the purpose of controlling or optimizing their behavior and performance These models are based on dynamical systems  differential or difference equations and mathematical programming formulations Research of the participating teams focusses on the identification  analysis  control and optimization of these models  including the corresponding theory  algorithmic aspects and numerical resolution techniques This area of growing interest finds numerous applications in various fields such as automatic control  biotechnology and biomedical engineering  mechanical and electrical engineering  production and supply chain management and planning  process engineering  robotics  routing  traffic or service networks and signal processing  Todays lecturers of this SOCN seminar are Rodolphe Sepulchre KU Leuven  University of CambridgeTom Chaffey University of Cambridge httpssitesuclouvainbesocndrupalsocnnode363 A seminar out of the SOCN seminar series on systems optimization control and networks seminarLeuvenSOCN Graduate School\r",
