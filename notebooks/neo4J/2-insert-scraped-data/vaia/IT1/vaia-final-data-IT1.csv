For those working with AI on a daily basis, staying up to date with the newest techniques within various domains is a challenge. In this seminar series, academic experts will bring you up to speed with the hottest topics: Advanced GenAI, Knowledge Graphs, MLOps and AI@Edge. All seminars include a hands-on component.|Advanced GenAI (17 April 2024  12.30-15.30h)Dr. Thomas WintersThese days  we are surrounded by creative text and image generators like GPT and diffusion models that seem to be able to generate anything we want. But how do we ensure that these types of AI truly aid us in overcoming our unique challenges? This talk sheds light on several techniques for controlling such generative models. We look at several powerful prompt engineering techniques – the art of enhancing our communication with AI – and useful ways of connecting these generators to other systems. We dive into the world of autoregressive text generators  learn their inner mechanisms and which training phases they went through to get to the current state-of-the-art text generators. These insights help us understand why certain prompt engineering techniques (such as few-shot prompting  role-prompting and chain-of-thought prompting) are able to outperform simpler prompting methods. We also briefly look at several other techniques to overcome the limitations of such models  such as retrieval-augmented generation and function calling. Similarly  we uncover the workings of diffusion models and show several techniques to gain more control over the generated images. We show how even some of AI's classic hard problems  such as humour generation  become even more within reach thanks to these large language models and their prompt engineering techniques.Knowledge Graphs (17 April 2024  16.00-19.00h)Prof. Pieter Bonte and prof. Anastasia DimouKnowledge graphs have become the ultimate technology for unlocking the full potential of your data  illuminating the connections between entities  attributes  and relationships with unparalleled clarity. Sharing & exchanging data  harvesting insights  driving innovation  fostering integration  and revolutionizing data exploration  knowledge graphs pave the way for transformative discoveries and understanding.In this seminar  the following topic will be tackled:Introduction to knowledge graphsSemantic Web basics: RDFFrom raw data to knowledge graphs with [R2]RMLUnlocking insights with querying through SPARQLMLOps (25 April 2024  12.30-15.30h)Prof. Mathias Verbeke and drs. Lara LuysOne of the main challenges for industry today is to get machine learning models out of the proof-of-concept phase and into production. This is not an easy task since data in production is not static  due to which the model performance can degrade over time. Machine learning operations or MLOps is a paradigm that aims to address this problem. Being a contraction of Machine Learning and DevOps  MLOps focuses on developing and maintaining machine learning models in production. This includes training  evaluating as well as monitoring the model. In this seminar  the MLOps pipeline and the underlying principles will be explained  illustrated by means of a number of tools that can be used in the MLOps process.AI@Edge (25 April 2024  16.00-19.00h)Prof. Hans Hallez and drs. Gregory De RuyterEdge Computing has been proven to be an optimised way to delegate computation from the cloud towards the devices where the sensing takes place. Edge computing on embedded devices mostly limits itself towards compression  filtering or other basic analysis. Recent trends also show that devices near the edge of the sensor network are capable of machine learning algorithms. In this session  we will explore different techniques to bring machine learning towards the edge network and deploy these algorithms. First  we will give an overview of what embedded devices are  and how we can perform machine learning at these devices both in inference and in training. Second  we will give a hands-on demonstration as an inspiration of how machine learning at the edge can be implemented.|Current Trends in AI Advanced GenAI 17 April 2024  12301530hDr Thomas WintersThese days  we are surrounded by creative text and image generators like GPT and diffusion models that seem to be able to generate anything we want But how do we ensure that these types of AI truly aid us in overcoming our unique challenges This talk sheds light on several techniques for controlling such generative models We look at several powerful prompt engineering techniques – the art of enhancing our communication with AI – and useful ways of connecting these generators to other systems We dive into the world of autoregressive text generators  learn their inner mechanisms and which training phases they went through to get to the current stateoftheart text generators These insights help us understand why certain prompt engineering techniques such as fewshot prompting  roleprompting and chainofthought prompting are able to outperform simpler prompting methods We also briefly look at several other techniques to overcome the limitations of such models  such as retrievalaugmented generation and function calling Similarly  we uncover the workings of diffusion models and show several techniques to gain more control over the generated images We show how even some of AIs classic hard problems  such as humour generation  become even more within reach thanks to these large language models and their prompt engineering techniquesKnowledge Graphs 17 April 2024  16001900hProf Pieter Bonte and prof Anastasia DimouKnowledge graphs have become the ultimate technology for unlocking the full potential of your data  illuminating the connections between entities  attributes  and relationships with unparalleled clarity Sharing  exchanging data  harvesting insights  driving innovation  fostering integration  and revolutionizing data exploration  knowledge graphs pave the way for transformative discoveries and understandingIn this seminar  the following topic will be tackledIntroduction to knowledge graphsSemantic Web basics RDFFrom raw data to knowledge graphs with R2RMLUnlocking insights with querying through SPARQLMLOps 25 April 2024  12301530hProf Mathias Verbeke and drs Lara LuysOne of the main challenges for industry today is to get machine learning models out of the proofofconcept phase and into production This is not an easy task since data in production is not static  due to which the model performance can degrade over time Machine learning operations or MLOps is a paradigm that aims to address this problem Being a contraction of Machine Learning and DevOps  MLOps focuses on developing and maintaining machine learning models in production This includes training  evaluating as well as monitoring the model In this seminar  the MLOps pipeline and the underlying principles will be explained  illustrated by means of a number of tools that can be used in the MLOps processAIEdge 25 April 2024  16001900hProf Hans Hallez and drs Gregory De RuyterEdge Computing has been proven to be an optimised way to delegate computation from the cloud towards the devices where the sensing takes place Edge computing on embedded devices mostly limits itself towards compression  filtering or other basic analysis Recent trends also show that devices near the edge of the sensor network are capable of machine learning algorithms In this session  we will explore different techniques to bring machine learning towards the edge network and deploy these algorithms First  we will give an overview of what embedded devices are  and how we can perform machine learning at these devices both in inference and in training Second  we will give a handson demonstration as an inspiration of how machine learning at the edge can be implemented The world of artificial intelligence evolves at an astonishing speed For those working with AI on a daily basis staying up to date with the newest techniques within various domains is a challenge In this seminar series academic experts will bring you up to speed with the hottest topics Advanced GenAI Knowledge Graphs MLOps and AIEdge All seminars include a handson component httpspuckuleuvenbenlopleidingcurrenttrendsinaikwdjog3exxqm4807 Bring AIprofessionals up to speed with the latest developments in the field lezingenreeksBruggeKU Leuven Postuniversitair Centrum VAIA|['data  harvesting', 'data exploration', 'knowledge graphs', 'machine learning', 'model performance', 'Machine learning', 'MLOps', 'Machine Learning', 'machine learning', 'Edge computing', 'machine learning', 'algorithms', 'machine learning', 'edge network', 'algorithms', 'machine learning', 'machine learning', 'artificial intelligence', 'GenAI', 'Knowledge Graphs', 'MLOps', 'AIEdge']

By participating in this course  you will gain the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the complex ethical landscape of the digital world and make informed decisions that align with your organisation's values.Our course will cover a range of important topics  including ethics frameworks and tools  regulation and legal issues  developing ethical technology  technology assessment  ethical dilemmas  and ethics in data and visualisation.This course is designed for professionals working in a wide range of organisations and industries. Whether you are employed in government  industry  academia  or the non-profit sector  you will benefit from the comprehensive coverage of key topics in Digital Ethics. The course is particularly relevant for those working in fields such as technology  interaction design  data analysis  policymaking  law  and research. However  anyone with an interest in Digital Ethics and the impact of technology on society will find value in this course.Session 1: Ethics frameworks – Thursday 18 April 2024During this session  we will explore the various frameworks that can be used to justify ethical decisions  including virtue ethics  consequence ethics  and duty ethics. The participants will learn how to 'think ethically'  and how these basic ethics frameworks can be applied to various scenarios in which digital technologies play a central role. We will also explore the concept of responsibility  including the different types of responsibility (moral  legal  causal or role responsibility) that can arise in the digital realm and discuss the responsibility gap. This session will provide attendees with a solid foundation in the basic principles of ethics and their relation to digital technology.Session 2: Building Ethical Foundations - Thursday 25 April 2024This session aims to create a communal learning environment among the participants  both online and on-site. During this session  participants will introduce themselves  share their professional backgrounds and discuss their expectations for the course  providing invaluable insight for the instructors to tailor the subsequent sessions. Additionally  participants will reflect on the ethical aspects of their jobs  exploring potential ethical dilemmas within their specific work contexts such as government  industry  academia  or non-profit sectors. This early engagement is designed to foster a deeper understanding and awareness of the ethical issues to be explored throughout the course  setting the stage for a more insightful reflection during the closing session.Session 3: Tools and methods for ethical decision making - Thursday 2 May 2024In this session we will introduce tools and methods that can be used to make ethical decisions in different contexts  such as in industry  government  academia and research. Participants will learn about practical frameworks and tools such as the guidance ethics approach  the AI Blindspots and the Data Ethics Decision Aid. This session will provide attendees with the basic tools and methods in the practice of ethical decision-making in the digital realm.Session 4: Technology assessment in practice – Thursday 16 May 2024This session will provide insight into the impact and effects of technology  and will introduce tools and methods for assessing the risks of innovation and averting undesirable consequences of new technologies. The session will look into the challenges of achieving (positive or negative) impacts with technology due to the interplay of technology  society  organisations and individuals. A dedicated focus will be on the impact of AI technologies in a government context as well as on evaluating the results of social corporate responsibility actions in the context of a company. This session will provide attendees with practical examples of how to effectively assess the risks and potential consequences of technology.Session 5: Designing ethical technology – Thursday 23 May 2024In this session  we will explore different approaches to designing technology that takes into account the needs and values of human beings. We will explore humanity-centered design (including design thinking)  inclusive design  value-centered design  and participatory design (or co-creation). We will then discuss how technologies are often designed in a way that threatens our digital well-being  and which strategies can be used to improve digital well-being. This session will provide attendees with the tools and knowledge they need to create ethical technology that is designed with people at its core.Session 6: Ethical topics and dilemmas – Thursday 30 May 2024This session will explore the application of behaviorist principles in digital technologies  particularly in the realm of surveillance. It will highlight how these technologies not only observe but actively influence and modify user behavior  raising important ethical questions about privacy  autonomy  and the power dynamics between users and technology providers. The session will emphasize the need for ethical guidelines to address the challenges posed by digital surveillance. This session further examines the various functions fairness and equality hold in the AI governance debate. Drawing from political philosophical theories of justice and practical use-cases  a relational perspective on AI is developed to understand better the social and technical dynamics that give rise to digital injustice. This session will provide attendees with an understanding of the ethical challenges that can arise in the digital world  and the tools and frameworks that can be used to address them.Session 7: Legal and policy issues – Thursday 6 June 2024This session will explore a number of legal issues that arise in the digital realm. This session will first provide attendees with an understanding of appropriate legal frameworks related to the free flow of information  (personal) data protection  and the principles  rights and obligations of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This session will also provide a comprehensive review of the impact AI may have on individual and collective human rights across various sectors. The participants will learn about the technical legal instruments at their disposal to combat AI discrimination  including legal tools related to direct and indirect discrimination  as well as discrimination by association. Moreover  participants will be invited to critically reflect on the resilience of ethics in the context of AI. This approach to AI will consider high-level legal instruments within the European Union  such as the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights  the proposed AI Act  and the set of equality directives. A comparative law approach will also be mobilized to provide a better understanding of addressing AI challenges with traditional legal instruments.Session 8: Ethics in data and visualisation – Thursday 13 June 2024In this session  we will discuss the ethical aspects of handling and visualising of data. We will start by examining how data are 'constructed' and therefore are inherently 'biased'  rather than representing an objective truth. We cross over to understand the value of visualising data  acknowledging its potential risk to yet further objectify this constructed  situated nature of data. We then dive into how some data visualisations can be (unintentionally) perceived as unethical  whether through potentially misleading design choices  the use of dubious data  the omission of uncertainties  or the disregard of cognitive biases. This session aims to provide practical skills and reflective insights for handling and visualising data in ways that are more transparent  equitable and responsible.Session 9: Closing and reflection – Thursday 20 June 2024The seventh and final session will be a closing session focused on reflection. In this session  participants will have the opportunity to reflect on how the topics covered in the previous sessions apply to their own professional situations. This session will provide a space for attendees to share their thoughts  insights  and experiences  and to discuss how they plan to incorporate the knowledge and skills they have gained into their work. This will be a valuable opportunity for participants to consolidate their learning and to develop a personal plan for applying the principles of Digital Ethics in their professional lives.|Digital

The term 'data space' has gained a lot of traction lately, specifically with the upcoming 'European Health Data Space' legislation. The definition of data space is still under discussion. However, we and others (e.g. NCP Flanders) describe it as ""a  decentralized infrastructure for trustworthy data sharing and exchange  in data ecosystems, based on commonly agreed principles."""|"In recent years  a series of health data spaces have arised. However  at the moment  the strategic oversight is lost and many questions remain. For example:Which data space initiatives are out there?How do they relate to each other?How will they work together/in synergy to maximize the impact?How will this affect the local data management at the level of the individual data partners?With this symposium  we aspire to facilitate an in-depth exploration of data spaces and research infrastructures  elucidate challenges and best practices for large-scale projects  and engage in a panel debate on the feasibility of implementing and integrating various data spaces at different levels  all underpinning the advancement of healthcare data sharing and research.The event plans to highlight different Belgian data spaces and to delve into profound discussions during panel debates  exploring complex topics like challenges and future perspectives in health data sharing and analysis. As i~HD will co-moderate the event  the bridge towards Europe is guaranteed.Target Audience: The symposium is tailored for health data enthusiasts from Belgium and neighboring countries. While expecting diverse attendees  both beginners and experts  we are aiming for accessibility without compromising depth.In our sessions  we explore a wide array of dimensions  ranging from geographical nuances to various data types and the complexities of transmural care.

Compared to traditional statistics  the absence of a focus on scientific hypotheses  and the need for easily leveraging detailed signals in the data require a different set of models  tools  and analytical reflexes.This course aims to bring participants to the level where they can independently tackle the analytical part of data mining projects. This means that the most common types of projects will be addressed - regression-type with continuous outcomes  classification with categorical outcomes  and clustering. For each of these  the practical use of a set of standard methods will be shown  like Random Forests  Gradient Boosting Machines  Support Vector Machines  k-Nearest-Neighbors  K-means ... Furthermore  throughout the course  concepts will be highlighted that are of concern in every statistical learning applications  like the curse of dimensionality  model capacity  overfitting and regularization  and practical strategies will be offered to deal with them  introducing techniques such as the Lasso and ridge regression  cross-validation  bagging and boosting. Instructions will also be given on a selection of specific techniques that are often of interest  such as modern visualization of high-dimensional data  model calibration  outlier detection using isolation forests  explanation of black-box models ... Finally  the last lecture will introduce the idea of deep learning as a powerful tool for data analysis  discussing when and how to practically use it  and when to shy away from it.Target audienceThis course targets professionals and investigators from all areas that are involved in predictive modeling based on large and/or high-dimensional databases.FeesThe participation fee is 1470 EUR for participants from the private sector.

For those working with AI on a daily basis, staying up to date with the newest techniques within various domains is a challenge. In this seminar series, academic experts will bring you up to speed with the hottest topics: Advanced GenAI, Knowledge Graphs, MLOps and AI@Edge. All seminars include a hands-on component.|Advanced GenAI (17 April 2024  12.30-15.30h)Dr. Thomas WintersThese days  we are surrounded by creative text and image generators like GPT and diffusion models that seem to be able to generate anything we want. But how do we ensure that these types of AI truly aid us in overcoming our unique challenges? This talk sheds light on several techniques for controlling such generative models. We look at several powerful prompt engineering techniques – the art of enhancing our communication with AI – and useful ways of connecting these generators to other systems. We dive into the world of autoregressive text generators  learn their inner mechanisms and which training phases they went through to get to the current state-of-the-art text generators. These insights help us understand why certain prompt engineering techniques (such as few-shot prompting  role-prompting and chain-of-thought prompting) are able to outperform simpler prompting methods. We also briefly look at several other techniques to overcome the limitations of such models  such as retrieval-augmented generation and function calling. Similarly  we uncover the workings of diffusion models and show several techniques to gain more control over the generated images. We show how even some of AI's classic hard problems  such as humour generation  become even more within reach thanks to these large language models and their prompt engineering techniques.Knowledge Graphs (17 April 2024  16.00-19.00h)Prof. Pieter Bonte and prof. Anastasia DimouKnowledge graphs have become the ultimate technology for unlocking the full potential of your data  illuminating the connections between entities  attributes  and relationships with unparalleled clarity. Sharing & exchanging data  harvesting insights  driving innovation  fostering integration  and revolutionizing data exploration  knowledge graphs pave the way for transformative discoveries and understanding.In this seminar  the following topic will be tackled:Introduction to knowledge graphsSemantic Web basics: RDFFrom raw data to knowledge graphs with [R2]RMLUnlocking insights with querying through SPARQLMLOps (25 April 2024  12.30-15.30h)Prof. Mathias Verbeke and drs. Lara LuysOne of the main challenges for industry today is to get machine learning models out of the proof-of-concept phase and into production. This is not an easy task since data in production is not static  due to which the model performance can degrade over time. Machine learning operations or MLOps is a paradigm that aims to address this problem. Being a contraction of Machine Learning and DevOps  MLOps focuses on developing and maintaining machine learning models in production. This includes training  evaluating as well as monitoring the model. In this seminar  the MLOps pipeline and the underlying principles will be explained  illustrated by means of a number of tools that can be used in the MLOps process.AI@Edge (25 April 2024  16.00-19.00h)Prof. Hans Hallez and drs. Gregory De RuyterEdge Computing has been proven to be an optimised way to delegate computation from the cloud towards the devices where the sensing takes place. Edge computing on embedded devices mostly limits itself towards compression  filtering or other basic analysis. Recent trends also show that devices near the edge of the sensor network are capable of machine learning algorithms. In this session  we will explore different techniques to bring machine learning towards the edge network and deploy these algorithms. First  we will give an overview of what embedded devices are  and how we can perform machine learning at these devices both in inference and in training. Second  we will give a hands-on demonstration as an inspiration of how machine learning at the edge can be implemented.|Current Trends in AI Advanced GenAI 17 April 2024  12301530hDr Thomas WintersThese days  we are surrounded by creative text and image generators like GPT and diffusion models that seem to be able to generate anything we want But how do we ensure that these types of AI truly aid us in overcoming our unique challenges This talk sheds light on several techniques for controlling such generative models We look at several powerful prompt engineering techniques – the art of enhancing our communication with AI – and useful ways of connecting these generators to other systems We dive into the world of autoregressive text generators  learn their inner mechanisms and which training phases they went through to get to the current stateoftheart text generators These insights help us understand why certain prompt engineering techniques such as fewshot prompting  roleprompting and chainofthought prompting are able to outperform simpler prompting methods We also briefly look at several other techniques to overcome the limitations of such models  such as retrievalaugmented generation and function calling Similarly  we uncover the workings of diffusion models and show several techniques to gain more control over the generated images We show how even some of AIs classic hard problems  such as humour generation  become even more within reach thanks to these large language models and their prompt engineering techniquesKnowledge Graphs 17 April 2024  16001900hProf Pieter Bonte and prof Anastasia DimouKnowledge graphs have become the ultimate technology for unlocking the full potential of your data  illuminating the connections between entities  attributes  and relationships with unparalleled clarity Sharing  exchanging data  harvesting insights  driving innovation  fostering integration  and revolutionizing data exploration  knowledge graphs pave the way for transformative discoveries and understandingIn this seminar  the following topic will be tackledIntroduction to knowledge graphsSemantic Web basics RDFFrom raw data to knowledge graphs with R2RMLUnlocking insights with querying through SPARQLMLOps 25 April 2024  12301530hProf Mathias Verbeke and drs Lara LuysOne of the main challenges for industry today is to get machine learning models out of the proofofconcept phase and into production This is not an easy task since data in production is not static  due to which the model performance can degrade over time Machine learning operations or MLOps is a paradigm that aims to address this problem Being a contraction of Machine Learning and DevOps  MLOps focuses on developing and maintaining machine learning models in production This includes training  evaluating as well as monitoring the model In this seminar  the MLOps pipeline and the underlying principles will be explained  illustrated by means of a number of tools that can be used in the MLOps processAIEdge 25 April 2024  16001900hProf Hans Hallez and drs Gregory De RuyterEdge Computing has been proven to be an optimised way to delegate computation from the cloud towards the devices where the sensing takes place Edge computing on embedded devices mostly limits itself towards compression  filtering or other basic analysis Recent trends also show that devices near the edge of the sensor network are capable of machine learning algorithms In this session  we will explore different techniques to bring machine learning towards the edge network and deploy these algorithms First  we will give an overview of what embedded devices are  and how we can perform machine learning at these devices both in inference and in training Second  we will give a handson demonstration as an inspiration of how machine learning at the edge can be implemented The world of artificial intelligence evolves at an astonishing speed For those working with AI on a daily basis staying up to date with the newest techniques within various domains is a challenge In this seminar series academic experts will bring you up to speed with the hottest topics Advanced GenAI Knowledge Graphs MLOps and AIEdge All seminars include a handson component httpspuckuleuvenbenlopleidingcurrenttrendsinaikwdjog3exxqm4807 Bring AIprofessionals up to speed with the latest developments in the field lezingenreeksBruggeKU Leuven Postuniversitair Centrum VAIA|['image generators', 'GPT', 'diffusion models', 'generative models', 'autoregressive text generators', 'text generators', 'prompt engineering', 'diffusion models', 'large language models', 'prompt engineering', 'data exploration', 'knowledge graphs', 'raw data', 'machine learning', 'Machine learning', 'Machine Learning', 'MLOps', 'machine learning', 'Edge computing', 'machine learning', 'algorithms', 'machine learning', 'edge network', 'algorithms', 'machine learning', 'machine learning', 'artificial intelligence']

From the handling of personal data to the development of new technologies  the decisions we make have the potential to impact individuals  society  and the environment in profound ways. By participating in this course  you will gain the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the complex ethical landscape of the digital world and make informed decisions that align with your organisation's values.Our course will cover a range of important topics  including ethics frameworks and tools  regulation and legal issues  developing ethical technology  technology assessment  ethical dilemmas  and ethics in data and visualisation.This course is designed for professionals working in a wide range of organisations and industries. Whether you are employed in government  industry  academia  or the non-profit sector  you will benefit from the comprehensive coverage of key topics in Digital Ethics. The course is particularly relevant for those working in fields such as technology  interaction design  data analysis  policymaking  law  and research. However  anyone with an interest in Digital Ethics and the impact of technology on society will find value in this course.Session 1: Ethics frameworks – Thursday 18 April 2024During this session  we will explore the various frameworks that can be used to justify ethical decisions  including virtue ethics  consequence ethics  and duty ethics. The participants will learn how to 'think ethically'  and how these basic ethics frameworks can be applied to various scenarios in which digital technologies play a central role. We will also explore the concept of responsibility  including the different types of responsibility (moral  legal  causal or role responsibility) that can arise in the digital realm and discuss the responsibility gap. This session will provide attendees with a solid foundation in the basic principles of ethics and their relation to digital technology.Session 2: Building Ethical Foundations - Thursday 25 April 2024This session aims to create a communal learning environment among the participants  both online and on-site. During this session  participants will introduce themselves  share their professional backgrounds and discuss their expectations for the course  providing invaluable insight for the instructors to tailor the subsequent sessions. Additionally  participants will reflect on the ethical aspects of their jobs  exploring potential ethical dilemmas within their specific work contexts such as government  industry  academia  or non-profit sectors. This early engagement is designed to foster a deeper understanding and awareness of the ethical issues to be explored throughout the course  setting the stage for a more insightful reflection during the closing session.Session 3: Tools and methods for ethical decision making - Thursday 2 May 2024In this session we will introduce tools and methods that can be used to make ethical decisions in different contexts  such as in industry  government  academia and research. Participants will learn about practical frameworks and tools such as the guidance ethics approach  the AI Blindspots and the Data Ethics Decision Aid. This session will provide attendees with the basic tools and methods in the practice of ethical decision-making in the digital realm.Session 4: Technology assessment in practice – Thursday 16 May 2024This session will provide insight into the impact and effects of technology  and will introduce tools and methods for assessing the risks of innovation and averting undesirable consequences of new technologies. The session will look into the challenges of achieving (positive or negative) impacts with technology due to the interplay of technology  society  organisations and individuals. A dedicated focus will be on the impact of AI technologies in a government context as well as on evaluating the results of social corporate responsibility actions in the context of a company. This session will provide attendees with practical examples of how to effectively assess the risks and potential consequences of technology.Session 5: Designing ethical technology – Thursday 23 May 2024In this session  we will explore different approaches to designing technology that takes into account the needs and values of human beings. We will explore humanity-centered design (including design thinking)  inclusive design  value-centered design  and participatory design (or co-creation). We will then discuss how technologies are often designed in a way that threatens our digital well-being  and which strategies can be used to improve digital well-being. This session will provide attendees with the tools and knowledge they need to create ethical technology that is designed with people at its core.Session 6: Ethical topics and dilemmas – Thursday 30 May 2024This session will explore the application of behaviorist principles in digital technologies  particularly in the realm of surveillance. It will highlight how these technologies not only observe but actively influence and modify user behavior  raising important ethical questions about privacy  autonomy  and the power dynamics between users and technology providers. The session will emphasize the need for ethical guidelines to address the challenges posed by digital surveillance. This session further examines the various functions fairness and equality hold in the AI governance debate. Drawing from political philosophical theories of justice and practical use-cases  a relational perspective on AI is developed to understand better the social and technical dynamics that give rise to digital injustice. This session will provide attendees with an understanding of the ethical challenges that can arise in the digital world  and the tools and frameworks that can be used to address them.Session 7: Legal and policy issues – Thursday 6 June 2024This session will explore a number of legal issues that arise in the digital realm. This session will first provide attendees with an understanding of appropriate legal frameworks related to the free flow of information  (personal) data protection  and the principles  rights and obligations of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This session will also provide a comprehensive review of the impact AI may have on individual and collective human rights across various sectors. The participants will learn about the technical legal instruments at their disposal to combat AI discrimination  including legal tools related to direct and indirect discrimination  as well as discrimination by association. Moreover  participants will be invited to critically reflect on the resilience of ethics in the context of AI. This approach to AI will consider high-level legal instruments within the European Union  such as the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights  the proposed AI Act  and the set of equality directives. A comparative law approach will also be mobilized to provide a better understanding of addressing AI challenges with traditional legal instruments.Session 8: Ethics in data and visualisation – Thursday 13 June 2024In this session  we will discuss the ethical aspects of handling and visualising of data. We will start by examining how data are 'constructed' and therefore are inherently 'biased'  rather than representing an objective truth. We cross over to understand the value of visualising data  acknowledging its potential risk to yet further objectify this constructed  situated nature of data. We then dive into how some data visualisations can be (unintentionally) perceived as unethical  whether through potentially misleading design choices  the use of dubious data  the omission of uncertainties  or the disregard of cognitive biases. This session aims to provide practical skills and reflective insights for handling and visualising data in ways that are more transparent  equitable and responsible.Session 9: Closing and reflection – Thursday 20 June 2024The seventh and final session will be a closing session focused on reflection. In this session  participants will have the opportunity to reflect on how the topics covered in the previous sessions apply to their own professional situations. This session will provide a space for attendees to share their thoughts  insights  and experiences  and to discuss how they plan to incorporate the knowledge and skills they have gained into their work. This will be a valuable opportunity for participants to consolidate their learning and to develop a personal plan for applying the principles of Digital Ethics in their professional lives.|Digital

The term 'data space' has gained a lot of traction lately, specifically with the upcoming 'European Health Data Space' legislation. The definition of data space is still under discussion. However, we and others (e.g. NCP Flanders) describe it as ""a  decentralized infrastructure for trustworthy data sharing and exchange  in data ecosystems, based on commonly agreed principles."""|"In recent years  a series of health data spaces have arised. However  at the moment  the strategic oversight is lost and many questions remain. For example:Which data space initiatives are out there?How do they relate to each other?How will they work together/in synergy to maximize the impact?How will this affect the local data management at the level of the individual data partners?With this symposium  we aspire to facilitate an in-depth exploration of data spaces and research infrastructures  elucidate challenges and best practices for large-scale projects  and engage in a panel debate on the feasibility of implementing and integrating various data spaces at different levels  all underpinning the advancement of healthcare data sharing and research.The event plans to highlight different Belgian data spaces and to delve into profound discussions during panel debates  exploring complex topics like challenges and future perspectives in health data sharing and analysis. As i~HD will co-moderate the event  the bridge towards Europe is guaranteed.Target Audience: The symposium is tailored for health data enthusiasts from Belgium and neighboring countries. While expecting diverse attendees  both beginners and experts  we are aiming for accessibility without compromising depth.In our sessions  we explore a wide array of dimensions  ranging from geographical nuances to various data types and the complexities of transmural care. We delve into the intricacies of first-line care  hospital settings  and innovative mobile healthcare (mHealth). Furthermore  our exploration extends to discovering the transformative potential inherent in different data types  encompassing everything from imaging to -omics and harmonized clinical data. #JoinTheJourney All speakers are asked to touch upon the following questions in preparation of their talk:What are their “why” and expected clinical impact?Which socio-technical challenges are they trying to address?What are their main achievements so far?What excites them for the future?10:00-10:10 | Meeting Start (Welcome)Liesbet M.

In this programme, we will explore the full spectrum of cybersecurity, from prevention to response, while gaining both immediate, hands-on skills and a foresight for the future of cybersecurity. This programme brings together academic researchers and industrial experts, and thus provides a blend of lectures and use cases and practical testimonials.|"Many companies rely on a Security Information and Event Management system (SIEM) to consolidate data from various applications and equipment  allowing them to maintain an overview of their security landscape. To investigate alerts generated by their SIEM system more thoroughly  they turn to a Network Protocol Analyzer (NPA). An NPA captures  analyzes  and visualizes network traffic and can have a broad range of applications.However  the procedures and configurations of NPAs vary according to the specific issue at hand (cybersecurity  troubleshooting  etc.)  which often leads to incorrect or inefficient usage in practice. During this workshop  we will build the knowledge and skills necessary to use Network Protocol Analyzers correctly and efficiently  particularly in the context of cybersecurity threats. We will work with real-life scenarios and gain practical insights into the underlying workings of NPAs. The NPA that we will delve deeper into during the workshop is the open-source NPA  Wireshark.This session is part of the series Cybersecurity excellence:Session 1: Tackling cybersecurity challenges: a complex security puzzle | 28 February 2024 - Vincent Naessens (KU Leuven)Session 2: ‘Privacy by design': a technical approach to privacy risk | 26 March 2024 - Kim Wuyts (PwC)Session 3: Efficient use of a 'network protocol analyzer' in cyber threats (workshop) | 24 April 2024 - Tom Cordemans (KU Leuven)Session 4: Hacking and protecting embedded devices (workshop) | 29 May 2024 - Jorn Lapon (KU Leuven)Session 5: EU cybersecurity standards and regulation for IoT ecosystems and Industrial Control Systems | 28 August 2024 - Vincent Naessens (KU Leuven)Session 6: Cyberattack response | 25 September 2024 - Tom Bauwens (Eubelius)  Kalman Tiboldi (TVH)Session 7: Post-quantum cryptography | 23 October 2024 - Eric Michiels (IBM)"|Efficient use of a network protocol analyzer in cyber threats Many companies rely on a Security Information and Event Management system SIEM to consolidate data from various applications and equipment  allowing them to maintain an overview of their security landscape To investigate alerts generated by their SIEM system more thoroughly  they turn to a Network Protocol Analyzer NPA An NPA captures  analyzes  and visualizes network traffic and can have a broad range of applicationsHowever  the procedures and configurations of NPAs vary according to the specific issue at hand cybersecurity  troubleshooting  etc  which often leads to incorrect or inefficient usage in practice During this workshop  we will build the knowledge and skills necessary to use Network Protocol Analyzers correctly and efficiently  particularly in the context of cybersecurity threats We will work with reallife scenarios and gain practical insights into the underlying workings of NPAs The NPA that we will delve deeper into during the workshop is the opensource NPA  WiresharkThis session is part of the series Cybersecurity excellenceSession 1 Tackling cybersecurity challenges a complex security puzzle  28 February 2024  Vincent Naessens KU LeuvenSession 2 ‘Privacy by design a technical approach to privacy risk  26 March 2024  Kim Wuyts PwCSession 3 Efficient use of a network protocol analyzer in cyber threats workshop  24 April 2024  Tom Cordemans KU LeuvenSession 4 Hacking and protecting embedded devices workshop  29 May 2024  Jorn Lapon KU LeuvenSession 5 EU cybersecurity standards and regulation for IoT ecosystems and Industrial Control Systems  28 August 2024  Vincent Naessens KU LeuvenSession 6 Cyberattack response  25 September 2024  Tom Bauwens Eubelius  Kalman Tiboldi TVHSession 7 Postquantum cryptography  23 October 2024  Eric Michiels IBM In an increasingly technologydriven world cybersecurity stands as the cornerstone of digital resilience In this programme we will explore the full spectrum of cybersecurity from prevention to response while gaining both immediate handson skills and a foresight for the future of cybersecurity This programme brings together academic researchers and industrial experts and thus provides a blend of lectures and use cases and practical testimonials httpspuckuleuvenbenlopleidingefficientuseofanetworkprotocolanalyzerincyberthreatsworkshopxdojwgde0jla3bpz Session 3  Cybersecurity excellence series 2024 workshopGhentKU Leuven Postuniversitair Centrum|['SIEM', 'SIEM', 'cybersecurity', 'Network Protocol Analyzers', 'cybersecurity', 'NPA', 'Cybersecurity', 'cybersecurity challenges', '‘Privacy by design', 'Hacking', 'EU cybersecurity standards', 'IoT', 'Cyberattack', 'cryptography', 'cybersecurity', 'cybersecurity', 'cybersecurity']

The audience for this course can include both novices with little or no previous experience with SEM, as well as existing users who wish to refresh or update their theoretical and practical understanding of structural equation modeling.||Participants should have a solid understanding of regression analysis and basic statistics (hypothesis testing, p-values, etc.). Some knowledge of (exploratory) factor analysis (or PCA) is recommended, but not required. Because lavaan is an R package, some experience with R (reading in a dataset, fitting a regression model) is recommended, but not required.|€340 - €750|https://beta-academy.ugent.be/en/program/short-and-long-running-initiatives/2023-2024-2024m13em-module-13-structural-equation|Structural equation modeling|Introduction to the theory and application of structural equation modeling and handling missing data, nonnormal data, categorical data, etc.|Introduction to the theory and application of structural equation modeling and handling missing data  nonnormal data  categorical data  etc.                            Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a general statistical modeling technique to study the relationships among observed and latent variables. It spans a wide range of multivariate methods including path analysis  mediation analysis  confirmatory factor analysis  growth curve modeling  and many more. Many applications of SEM can be found in the social  economic  behavioral and health sciences  but the technology is increasingly used in disciplines like biology  neuroscience and operation research. SEM is often used to test theories or hypotheses that can be represented by a path diagram. In a path diagram  observed variables are depicted by boxes  while latent variables (hypothetical constructs measured by multiple indicators) are depicted by circles. Hypothesized (possibly causal) effects among these variables are represented by single-headed arrows. If you had ever found yourself drawing a path diagram in order to get a better overview of the complex interrelations among some key variables in your data  this course is for you.The first day of the course provides an introduction to the theory and application of structural equation modeling  and illustrates how to use the open-source R package `lavaan’ (see https://lavaan.org) to conduct an SEM analysis. On the second day  we discuss several special topics that are often needed by applied users (handling missing data  nonnormal data  categorical data  longitudinal data  multilevel data  etc.). With the exception of a short practical session at the end of the first day  the two days are mostly lectures  to maximize the amount of information that we can teach. However  do-it-yourself practicals (with written feedback and solutions) will be made available and illustrate all the topics that are covered in this course.Target audienceThis course targets everyone with an interest in testing theories or models that involve relationships between both observed and latent variables. The audience for this course can include both novices with little or no previous experience with SEM  as well as existing users who wish to refresh or update their theoretical and practical understanding of structural equation modeling.FeesThe participation fee is 750 EUR for participants from the private sector.

You will be able to build basic applications using IDP, and you will be able to identify potential use cases for this technology.|"In their day-to-day operations  companies typically make many small but important decisions  such as: which employee should handle an incoming requestwhich service should be recommended to a specific customerhow should a specific product be configured to meet a customer's requirement whether a specific customer is entitled to a discount  etc. Decision support systems can help employees make these decisions faster  more reliably and more consistently  reducing costs and increasing confidence in the process. To develop such systems  black-box AI methods (such as deep learning) are not well-suited  because they lack the required transparency and explainability. A more promising approach are knowledge-based AI systems  which derive their 'intelligence' not from data  but from logical models of rules  regulations and expert knowledge.In this workshop  you will get to know the state-of-the-art IDP knowledge-base system  developed at KU Leuven. It is currently being used by companies in the manufacturing (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpPe0GRjifE)  financial (https://youtu.be/Zzsy4MtdWBE) and legal sectors to provide various decision support  both to their customers and in-house. This system is based on methods and techniques that were developed for declarative programming systems such as Prolog  but it offers a number of important innovations: (1) instead of focusing only on querying  the IDP system provides a wide range of different functionalities that can be used to implement rich interactive interfaces that support users in different work-flows  (2) instead of relying on programmers  the system allows its end users to maintain the underlying knowledge base  which means that we can cut out the ""middle man"" of IT staff and allow the business experts themselves to update the system  thereby not only reducing cost and turn-around time but also putting the ownership of the decision knowledge in the right hands.The workshop starts with a brief introduction to Knowledge-based AI and presents existing applications in the financial and manufacturing sectors.

The programme's goal is to offer participants the latest insights on AI from various perspectives, and in particular the fields of law, ethics and policy.|In 2021  KU Leuven organised the first edition of the Summer School on the Law  Ethics and Policy of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Given the programme's overwhelming success  three editions have taken place thus far. The fourth edition will take place from 1 to 10 July 2024.The Summer School aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the various legal  ethical and policy-related issues around AI and algorithm-driven processes more broadly. As these technologies have a growing impact on all domains of our lives  it becomes increasingly important to map  understand and assess the challenges and opportunities they raise. This requires an interdisciplinary approach  which is why we are collaborating across faculties and departments to organise this Summer School. The programme's goal is to offer participants the latest insights on AI from various perspectives  and in particular the fields of law  ethics and policy. The lectures are provided by renowned academics  policy-makers from EU and international institutions as well as practitioners  allowing participants to grasp not only the theoretical but also the practical implications of the use of AI in these fields. The Summer School's intended audience concerns postgraduate students who already obtained a master's degree and junior/senior researchers from various disciplines  as well as policy analysts  lawyers and legal experts  civil servants  members of civil society organisations  AI practitioners  and other professionals with an interest in broadening their understanding of AI and its impact on society. Participants receive a certificate of attendance with the equivalence of 3 ECTS credits. Those interested also have an opportunity to share their research with fellow participants through a research presentation session. Thus far  the Summer School has taken place as a hybrid event  enabling participants to join both on campus and online. Whether physically or virtually  we look forward to welcoming you to Leuven!Course overviewThe Summer School covers a range of topics that will enable participants to better grasp the various legal  ethical and policy implications of the development and use of AI in society. All lectures are taught in English.The schedule of the Summer School's 2023 edition can be found here.Most lectures focus on horizontal domains of interest  covering topics such as:Philosophy of AIEthics of AIAI and Data Protection LawAI and Competition LawAI and Intellectual Property LawAI and Consumer ProtectionAI and Liability LawAI and Labour LawAI and FairnesThe European Commission's proposals for an AI Regulation  the Digital Services Act & the Digital Markets ActAI governance and the role of European & International institutionsThough Artificial Intelligence is a general purpose technology  many of its legal  ethical and policy-related implications are context- or sector-specific. Therefore  the programme also explores several vertical domains. These cover inter alia:AI and Law EnforcementAI and Public ServicesAI and WarfareAI and HealthcareAI and EducationAI and Legal TechAt the end of the course  participants who attended 90% of the classes and passed the exam receive a certificate of attendance with an equivalence of 3 ECTS credits.
