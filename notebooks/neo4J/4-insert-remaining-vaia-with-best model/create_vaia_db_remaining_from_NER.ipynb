First  she will introduce multi-modal deep learning models that predict drug response while highlighting the genetic and chemical patterns that were more informative to make a prediction. Rodriguez Martinez also discusses how reinforcement learning approaches can facilitate the early phases of drug discovery and support the personalized design of new candidate compounds. Focusing next on T cell-based immunotherapies  she presents a model to predict the binding of T cell receptors and epitopes. This model can be coupled with an easy-to-use interpretable pipeline to extract the binding rules governing the T cell binding. These approaches are a first step towards the design and engineering of receptors of improved affinity. Finally  she will briefly discuss how interpretable models enable the linkage of different data modalities  such as image and molecular data. In doing so  they can pave the way to the development of personalized models of therapeutic interventions.

Recent studies used reinforcement learning to solve challenging problems such as wind farm control, epidemic mitigation, and robot control.', 'full_body': ' Reinforcement learning concerns a distinct branch in the field of machine learning. While supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques learn based on a set of instances  reinforcement learning concerns an agent that learns by interacting with an environment. To illustrate this setting  consider a video game  where the agent identifies as the player of the game. The environment concerns the video game that can be controlled with a gamepad and observed by looking at the screen. The agent receives feedback from the environment in terms of rewards  for example via a game score. Based on this feedback and the observations of the environment  a reinforcement learning agent aims at learning to play the game optimally  by interacting repeatedly with the environment. In this course  we will study both the reinforcement learning problem and the algorithms that can be used to approach such problems. Over the last years  several important milestones were achieved using the reinforcement learning framework  such as learning to play ATARI 2600 video games  learning to play the board game Go to beat the number one human player and learning to reach grandmaster performance in the real-time strategy game Starcraft II. However  reinforcement learning is no longer limited to games  as many real-world problems can be formulated as a reinforcement learning problem. Recent studies used reinforcement learning to solve challenging problems such as wind farm control  epidemic mitigation  and robot control. In this course  we will convey the fundamentals that underlie reinforcement learning. To achieve this  we will start from intuition and applications to move towards formalisms that can implement a reinforcement learning agent. To move from formalisms to practice  we will explore these concepts in a grid-world environment using the python programming language. 10:00-12:00 Lecture13:00-15:00 Practical Session ', 'data': 'A deep dive into reinforcement learning  Reinforcement learning concerns a distinct branch in the field of machine learning While supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques learn based on a set of instances  reinforcement learning concerns an agent that learns by interacting with an environment To illustrate this setting  consider a video game  where the agent identifies as the player of the game The environment concerns the video game that can be controlled with a gamepad and observed by looking at the screen The agent receives feedback from the environment in terms of rewards  for example via a game score Based on this feedback and the observations of the environment  a reinforcement learning agent aims at learning to play the game optimally  by interacting repeatedly with the environment In this course  we will study both the reinforcement learning problem and the algorithms that can be used to approach such problems Over the last years  several important milestones were achieved using the reinforcement learning framework  such as learning to play ATARI 2600 video games  learning to play the board game Go to beat the number one human player and learning to reach grandmaster performance in the realtime strategy game Starcraft II However  reinforcement learning is no longer limited to games  as many realworld problems can be formulated as a reinforcement learning problem Recent studies used reinforcement learning to solve challenging problems such as wind farm control  epidemic mitigation  and robot control In this course  we will convey the fundamentals that underlie reinforcement learning To achieve this  we will start from intuition and applications to move towards formalisms that can implement a reinforcement learning agent To move from formalisms to practice  we will explore these concepts in a gridworld environment using the python programming language 10001200 Lecture13001500 Practical Session  Reinforcement learning is no longer limited to games as many realworld problems can be formulated as a reinforcement learning problem Recent studies used reinforcement learning to solve challenging problems such as wind farm control epidemic mitigation and robot control httpswwwflamesstatisticscomiucourses64 Using reinforcement learning to solve challenging real world problems CourseBrusselsVAIA amp Flames', 'skills': \"['reinforcement learning', 'Reinforcement learning', 'machine learning', 'machine learning', 'reinforcement learning', 'algorithms', 'reinforcement learning', 'reinforcement learning', 'python', 'programming', 'reinforcement learning', 'reinforcement learning']\"}, {'title': 'Responsible AI in practice', 'url': 'https://www.vaia.be/en/courses/responsible-ai-in-practice-assessing-risks-of-an-ai-ml-system', 'date': '6/02/2023', 'course_info': 'Training-Utrecht-Rhite', 'start_time': '6 Feb 2023 09:00 - 17:00', 'language': 'English', 'location_detail': 'Utrecht, The Netherlands', 'target_group': 'Target audience: Privacy pros, data scientists, engineers, any stakeholder working with or interested in AI', 'subscription_limit': 'NA', 'constraints': 'none', 'price': '€ 795,- (Excl.

Willems  remained till recently an esoteric niche of research. The renewed interest in the last years is because of its unique suitability for the newly emerged data-driven paradigm  specifically the representation-free perspective on dynamical systems as sets of trajectories. A result derived in the behavioral setting that became known as the fundamental lemma started a new class of subspace-type data-driven methods. The fundamental lemma gives conditions for a non-parametric representation of a linear time-invariant system by the image of a Hankel matrix constructed from raw time series data. This course reviews the fundamental lemma  its generalizations  and related data-driven analysis  signal processing  and control methods. A prototypical signal processing problem considered in the course is interpolation and approximation of trajectories. It includes simulation  state estimation  and output tracking control as special cases. The theory leads to computationally tractable methods. Regularized version of the methods is robust to noise and model assumptions. Participants will get hands-on experience with the methods via Matlab exercises and individual work on mini-projects. The course consists of six 2.5-hour sessions. A session starts with an introduction  followed by questions-and-answers and exercises. After the third session  students will choose mini-projects to work on. The course will not cover a fixed curriculum and will be adapted as much as possible to the need and interests of the participants.

Personal Data Minimization (PDM) is a core principle of privacy protection  whereby the amount of personal data in data sets is adjusted to the level needed for the legitimate data usage in mind (i.e.  for the aimed study or system functionality). Mainly  Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) tools and mechanisms are used for the PDM of micro and tabular data sets. SDC technology aims at mitigating the disclosure of privacy sensitive information to adversaries who have access to the content of such data sets. Applying SDC methods is necessary before storing the data sets  sharing them with scientific community or partner organisations  or opening them to the public. Using a SDC tool  an expert can apply advanced SDC algorithms with proper parameters to a data set (i.e.  transform the data set)  gain insights into the utility of the original and the transformed data sets  estimate the data disclosure risks of the original and the transformed data sets  and eventually make appropriate trade-offs between the indicators of data utility and data disclosure risks. The task of applying SDC into practice  however  increasingly becomes difficult due to the growth of data volume  variety  velocity ... and the availability of background information to adversaries. Data growth makes it difficult to detect potential privacy issues hidden in data sets (relating to the intrinsic characteristics of data sets) and background information makes it difficult to assess the potential risks when combining sensitive data sets with other ones (relating to the extrinsic characteristics of data sets). prerequisite knowledge: Being familiar with basics of mathematicsUsed tools: ARX and ARXaaSDuration: Four half-day sessions (each of about 3 hours)  organized in two consecutive days 1: Introduction by Mortaza S.

Although these systems generally produce outstanding results, they are also imperfect, just like human beings. While the added value of these systems is that they are able to match or exceed human performance in a way that is both faster and cheaper, a fundamental challenge remains that it is impossible to rule out occasional incorrect results.', 'full_body': \" Consequently  the legal relevance of AI systems is growing rapidly  especially when these systems are used to support a party in the process of contract formation. This seminar focuses on four applications in which parties may consider an AI system’s analysis in the decision (not) to conclude a contract. To begin with  AI systems are increasingly being used to support due diligence in M&A transactions. In an HR context  these systems are relied upon to analyse resumes or employee performance. AI systems are used as a contracting tool in the banking and insurance sector as well  e.g. to quickly assess the situation and work out an appropriate settlement that the other party is likely to accept. Finally  these systems can also be used in the art sector to assess the authenticity of a piece of art. These applications can help support the work of lawyers and in-house counsel. However  because AI systems are not flawless  they can also give rise to disputes. The resolution of such disputes depends on the difficult assessment of whether a party was entitled to rely on the AI system in given situation  and on the identification of the relevant legal regime. To facilitate this analysis  lawyers  company lawyers and judges may benefit from a basic understanding of the advantages and legal challenges of the use of AI systems to support contract formation  which will be discussed during this seminar. 09:00 - 09:10 uur: Opening remarks Prof. dr.

From the point of view of sensing  state estimation  and data fusion must be performed in a very short time  and for units  that are typically spatially dispersed. From the point of view of  determining a control objective to support automatic decisions  the  challenge is how to understand the impact of a decision in terms of  system performance. Almost all of those problems have to deal with  unknown future states  which must be predicted  typically by model-based  or black box approaches  also based on advanced analytics. Once an  objective function and optimization variables are determined   optimization models can help to find a solution quickly and effectively.  Further challenges are the acceptance of decision stakeholders  within  the control room  but also within the travelers and operators  or the  direct implementation of automatic digital control. For  passenger-oriented traffic control  this is particularly interesting and  challenging  due to the large amount of possible decisions per decision  maker  and data that can partially describe those aspects  which calls  for machine learning approaches. To reach all those goals  the system  must have room for control  in another sense  flexibility in operations  must be built in already from the planning  to be exploited in the  real-time horizon when needed. by Leon Sobrie - On Track Lab Digitisation and employee workload (im)balance are intertwined. To address undesirable workload peaks and lows  we propose a 2-step machine learning model to provide real-time workload analytics per controller in digital safety-critical control rooms. The advocated model leverages a rich real-time data structure with disaggregated event-level taskload data.

None of the modules overlap in time  allowing students to engage at a reasonable pace  over the course of the first and second semester. This micro-credential focuses on the following learning outcomes. 1. The participant will have theoretical knowledge about the history and the main frameworks of Machine Learning. 2. The participant will have theoretical knowledge of the main machine learning algorithms and paradigms and will study some of them in depth. 3. The participant will be able to develop machine learning pipelines and set up their own machine learning experiments using Python modules. 4. The participant will have theoretical and practical knowledge of machine learning using neural networks. 5. The participant will understand the fundamental problems and approaches in automatic Natural Language Processing and know its history as a subfield within Linguistics and Artificial Intelligence. 6. The participant will have insight into the basic algorithms developed within NLP for morphological  syntactic  semantic  and discourse processing. 7. The participant will acquire hands-on experience with software for text categorization  language understanding  translation  and generation.

This course is a study of the basic building blocks of decision-making agents  which are abstract entities living in an uncertain environment and are guided towards the realisation of given objectives. An agent is typically endowed with a knowledge base  a collection of facts expressed in some logical language  and an action repertoire at each state. The agent can reason about the environment  using their knowledge base  and take decisions accordingly. The environment is typically unknown  stochastic  and evolves following some rules that might be unknown to the agent  as well. On top of this  it is usually inhabited by other agents  which may or may not strive to achieve similar objectives. The task is to take the best possible decision that can be taken given the (incomplete) information available.

In this session we go into depth on the data based algorithms called  machine and deep learning techniques. Prof. dr. Dirk Valkenborg  (UHasselt) will show different kinds of algorithms like supervised and  unsupervised learning methods and discuss the basic terminology  involved. Being a researcher at the Data Science Institute (DSI) and the Flanders AI Research program (FLAIR)  he gives an insight on some of his own projects which are relevant to the pharmaceutical industry (also see SPEED-XM). It’s important to collect relevant data in order to start these  machine learning pipelines. Having experience in MS research and the MS Data Alliance  and expertise on data integration and engineering  Tina and Marcel  Parciak (UHasselt) discuss how you can scale up your health data by  combining data from different repositories. Centralised and federated  approaches might be possible but still need a common language. Therefore  a common data model like OMOP can provide a solution.

There is no such thing as the ultimate approach  but rather a range of measures and activities that can be applied to strengthen the S&P posture. This can be at the level of requirements and specification  at the level of coding  in security testing  etc. This module will cover the overall landscape and zoom into some of the most promising techniques.

Speaker : Stephen Lernout  Head of Strategy & Innovation @ Nalantis Local city authorities have mountains of data  which only continue to grow as decisions are made on a monthly basis. This data overload makes it hard for city employees to quickly find and access the right information. At the same time  citizens have questions and expect quick responses from city personnel regarding topics from garbage disposal to parking and building regulations. This is extremely frustrating for both the city employees and the citizens.

This type of splitting arises when the datasets from different sources cannot be aggregated on one single machine or when the available machines are of different powers. A de-biased estimator of the precision matrix on every single machine is proposed  and theoretical guarantees are provided. Moreover  a new de-biased estimator that is pooled across the machines using a composite likelihood approach is proposed. It is shown to enjoy consistency and asymptotic normality  and we provide statistical inference strategies based on it. The performance of this estimator is investigated via simulation studies and real data exam- ples. It is shown that the performance of this estimator is close to the non-distributed estimator  which uses the entire dataset. 12:00–1:00 pmon-campus (KU Leuven Faculty of Economics and Business HOGM 01.85) or online via Zoom (https://us02web.zoom.us/j/88418552909?pwd=MERhSDAvSVdET0xKWnpFOUxHOVJMUT09)24 February 2022 Elia Lapenta (ENSAE Paris) “Nonparametric instrumental variable estimation without smoothing on the instruments”  We propose a new estimation method for nonparametric models identified by Instru- mental Variables (IVs). The estimation is based on a class of Generically Comprehensively Revealing functions. Compared to methods available in the literature that smooth on the IVs  our estimation does not smooth on the instruments and thus requires the selection of less tun- ing parameters. Furthermore  it does not suffer from a curse of dimensionality on the IVs. We show that our procedure is equivalent to a classical estimation method that smooths on the Ivs but keeps the bandwidth fixed as the sample size increases.  We then extend our methodology to estimate a partly linear model with endogenous variables. We obtain convergence rates for the estimator of the nonparametric part of the model and the asymptotic normality of the estimator of the parametric components. To deal with the ill- posedness of the inverse problem  we use a Landweber-Friedman regularization. This has the advantage of being a simple iterative method that avoids the inversion of a large matrix whose dimension increases with the sample size. We finally study the implementation of our proce- dure and propose a data-driven selection of the regularization and the smoothing parameters.

A clustering algorithm should be able  despite of this heterogene- ity  to extract discriminant pieces of information from the variables in order to design groups. In this work we introduce a multilayer architecture model-based clustering method called Mixed Deep Gaussian Mixture Model (MDGMM) that can be viewed as an automatic way to merge the clustering performed separately on continuous and non-continuous data. This architecture is flexible and can be adapted to mixed as well as to continuous or non-continuous data. In this sense we generalize Generalized Linear Latent Variable Models and Deep Gaussian Mixture Models. We also design a new initialisation strategy and a data driven method that selects the best specification of the model and the optimal number of clusters for a given dataset “on the fly”. Besides  our model provides continuous low-dimensional representations of the data which can be a useful tool to visualize mixed datasets. Finally  we validate the performance of our approach comparing its results with state-of-the-art mixed data clustering models over several commonly used datasets.12:00–1:00 pmonline10 March 2022 Cavit Pakel (Bilkent University) “Bounds on average effects in discrete choice panel data models”  Average effects in discrete choice panel data models with individual-specific fixed effects are generally only partially identified in short panels. While consistent estimation of the identified set is possible  it generally requires very large sample sizes  especially when the number of support points of the observed covariates is large  such as when the covariates are continuous. In this paper  we propose estimating outer bounds on the identified set of average effects. Our bounds are easy to construct  converge at the parametric rate  and are computationally simple to obtain even in moderately large samples  independent of whether the covariates are discrete or continuous. We also provide asymptotically valid confidence intervals on the identified set. Simulation studies confirm that our approach works well and is informative in finite samples. We also consider an application to labor force participation.

In addition  we use the bootstrap to generate plausible synthetic samples of data not seen in historical real data to create statistics of interest pertaining to uncertainty. While our approach is generic we focus on robust portfolio allocation problems as an application and study the impact of risk versus uncer- tainty in a dynamic mean-variance setting. We show that a mean-variance optimizing investor achieves economically meaningful wealth gains (33%) across our sample from 1996-2019 by internalizing our uncertainty measure during portfolio formation.

In this talk  we will address post-selection inference through approximate maximum likelihood estimation. Our goal is to: (i) efficiently utilize hold-out information from selection with the aid of randomization  (ii) bypass expensive MCMC sampling from exact conditional distri- butions that are hard to evaluate in closed forms. At the core of our new method is the solution to a convex optimization problem which assumes a separable form across multiple learning queries during selection. We illustrate the potential of our method across wide-ranging values of signal-to-noise ratio in simulated experiments. 12:00–1:00 pm  online31 March 2022 Limin Peng (Emory University) “Heterogeneous individual risk modeling of recurrent events”  Progression of chronic disease is often manifested by repeated occurrences of disease-related events over time. Delineating the heterogeneity in the risk of such recurrent events can provide valuable scientific insight for guiding customized disease management. In this paper  we propose a new sensible measure of individual risk of recurrent events and present a dynamic modeling framework thereof  which accounts for both observed covariates and unobservable frailty. The proposed modeling requires no distributional specification of the unobservable frailty  while permitting the exploration of dynamic effects of the observed covari- ates. We develop estimation and inference procedures for the proposed model through a novel adaptation of the principle of conditional score. The asymptotic properties of the proposed es- timator  including the uniform consistency and weak convergence  are established. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate satisfactory finite-sample performance of the proposed method.

It occurs when the explanatory variables are not independent of the error term and results in inconsistent estimators of the model pa- rameters. This seminar summarizes the causes  impact  and state of the art methods to detect and to address endogeneity in discrete choice models  which are related  but differ in relevant aspects  from those of linear model. The emphasis is put on providing the theoretical funda- mentals and the intuition behind the problems that may arise  as well as practical details as on how to apply the methods to address them  stressing the main considerations that must be taken in this endeavor. The main concepts are formally stated  and references are given to specific recent articles for further details that may be required for advanced applications or a deeper understanding. The seminar begins providing details on the definition  impact  causes and examples of endogeneity in discrete choice models  followed by a revision of possible approaches to detect this problem. Then  a deep review of the fundamentals  intuition and practicalities of the various methods that can be used to address endogeneity is presented  followed by a section providing insights and methods related to the obtention and validation of instrumental variables  which are key in this effort. The seminar continues then revising the problem of forecasting with discrete choice models that have been corrected for endogeneity  finalizing with a summary of the main conclusions and takeaways. 5:00–6:00 pmonline28 April 2022 Cécile Adam (KU Leuven) “Local linear functional mean regression under censoring”  Among the main interests in regression analysis is to explore the influence that a functional has on a real-valued variable of interest  the response. There is some literature on flexible mean regression  in which the targeted quantity is the conditional mean of the response given the functional. Another interest in statistics is to study the regression under the condition of censoring in which the values of the response are only partially known. After an introduc- tion to mean regression function estimation in which the response variable is subject to right random censorship  different statistical methodology are presented. The finite-sample perfor- mance of the estimators is investigated via a simulation study. (Joint work with I. Gijbels and G. Claeskens.) 12:00–1:00 pm  on campus 5 May 2022 Wiktor Budzinski (University of Warsaw) “Hybrid choice models vs. endogeneity of indicator variables: a Monte Carlo investigation”  We investigate the problem of endogeneity in the context of hybrid choice (integrated choice and latent variable) models. We first provide a thorough analysis of potential causes of endogeneity and propose a working taxonomy. We demonstrate that although it is widely believed that the hybrid choice framework is devoid of the endogeneity problem  there is no theoretical reason to expect that this is the case. We then demonstrate empirically that the problem exists in the hybrid choice framework too. By conducting a Monte Carlo experiment  we display the extent of the bias resulting from measurement and endogeneity biases. Finally  we propose two novel solutions to address the problem: by explicitly accounting for correlation between structural and discrete choice component error terms (or with random parameters in a utility function)  or by introducing additional latent variables. Using simulated data  we demonstrate that these approaches work as expected  that is  they result in unbiased estimates of all model parameters. 12:00–1:00 pm online12 May 2022 Wendun Wang (Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam) “Recovering spillover structures with structural breaks in panel data models”  This paper aims at capturing time-varying spillover effects in a panel data setting. We consider panel models where the outcome of a unit not only depends on own characteristics and also the characteristics of other units (spillover effects). The effect of own characteristics can be unit-specific or homogeneous (common effects). We allow the spillover structure  i.e.  which units interact with which  to be latent  and the structure and effect of spillovers may both vary over time. We model time-varying spillovers via structural breaks with unknown break points. To estimate the break points  spillover and common effects  we solve a penalized least squares optimization and employ double machine learning procedures to improve the conver- gence and inference. We establish the super consistency of the estimated break point and provide the convergence rate of estimated spillover and common effects. We illustrate the theory via simulated and empirical data. 12:00–1:00 pm on-campus19 May 2022 Thierry Magnac (Toulouse School of Economics) “Linear models with interval-censored explanatory variables”  This paper studies the problem of inference in a set identified problem defined by linear moment restrictions with interval-censored variables. It introduces a novel and tractable inference procedure based on characterizing the identified set of the coefficient of interest in terms of the solution to convex optimization problems with equality constraints. Monte Carlo experiments evaluate the numerical performance of the novel inference procedure and compare it with existing ones.12:00–1:00 pm on-campus ', 'data': 'Statistics and Econometrics Seminars

framework is introduced for the sparse precision matrix in the covariateadjusted Gaussian graphical models under the un balanced splitting setting This type of splitting arises when the datasets from different sources cannot be aggregated on one single machine or when the available machines are of different powers A debiased estimator of the precision matrix on every single machine is proposed  and theoretical guarantees are provided Moreover  a new debiased estimator that is pooled across the machines using a composite likelihood approach is proposed It is shown to enjoy consistency and asymptotic normality  and we provide statistical inference strategies based on it The performance of this estimator is investigated via simulation studies and real data exam ples It is shown that the performance of this estimator is close to the nondistributed estimator  which uses the entire dataset 1200–100 pmoncampus KU Leuven Faculty of Economics and Business HOGM 0185 or online via Zoom

propose a new estimation method for nonparametric models identified by Instru mental Variables IVs The estimation is based on a class of Generically Comprehensively Revealing functions Compared to methods available in the literature that smooth on the IVs  our estimation does not smooth on the instruments and thus requires the selection of less tun ing parameters Furthermore  it does not suffer from a curse of dimensionality on the IVs We show that our procedure is equivalent to a classical estimation method that smooths on the Ivs but keeps the bandwidth fixed as the sample size increases  We then extend our methodology to estimate a partly linear model with endogenous variables We obtain convergence rates for the estimator of the nonparametric part of the model and the asymptotic normality of the estimator of the parametric components To deal with the ill posedness of the inverse problem  we use a LandweberFriedman regularization This has the advantage of being a simple iterative method that avoids the inversion of a large matrix whose dimension increases with the sample size We finally study the implementation of our proce dure and propose a datadriven selection of the regularization and the smoothing parameters Joint work with JeanPierre Florens 1200–100 pmoncampus KU Leuven room HOGM 0085 or online3 March 2022 Robin Fuchs Institut de Mathématiques de

clustering algorithm should be able  despite of this heterogene ity  to extract discriminant pieces of information from the variables in order to design groups In this work we introduce a multilayer architecture modelbased clustering method called Mixed Deep Gaussian Mixture Model MDGMM that can be viewed as an automatic way to merge the clustering performed separately on continuous and noncontinuous data This architecture is flexible and can be adapted to mixed as well as to continuous or noncontinuous data In this sense we generalize Generalized Linear Latent Variable Models and Deep Gaussian Mixture Models We also design a new initialisation strategy and a data driven method that selects the best specification of the model and the optimal number of clusters for a given dataset “on the fly” Besides  our model provides continuous lowdimensional representations of the data which can be a useful tool to visualize mixed datasets Finally  we validate the performance of our approach comparing its results with stateoftheart mixed data clustering models over several commonly used datasets1200–100 pmonline10 March 2022 Cavit Pakel Bilkent University “Bounds on average effects in discrete choice panel data models”  Average effects in discrete choice panel data models with individualspecific fixed effects are generally only partially identified in short panels While consistent estimation of the identified set is possible  it generally requires very large sample sizes  especially when the number of support points of the observed covariates is large  such as when the covariates are continuous In this paper  we propose estimating outer bounds on the identified set of average effects Our bounds are easy to construct  converge at the parametric rate  and are computationally simple to obtain even in moderately large samples  independent of whether the covariates are discrete or continuous We also provide asymptotically valid confidence intervals on the identified set Simulation studies confirm that our approach works well and is informative in finite samples We also consider an application to labor force participation Joint work with Martin Weidner

learning to impose guidance and dis cipline on the formulation of expectations in a datarich environment In addition  we use the bootstrap to generate plausible synthetic samples of data not seen in historical real data to create statistics of interest pertaining to uncertainty While our approach is generic we focus on robust portfolio allocation problems as an application and study the impact of

utilize holdout information from selection with the aid of randomization  ii bypass expensive MCMC sampling from exact conditional distri butions that are hard to evaluate in closed forms At the core of our new method is the solution to a convex optimization problem which assumes a separable form across multiple learning queries during selection We illustrate the potential of our method across

Progression of chronic disease is often manifested by repeated occurrences of diseaserelated events over time Delineating the heterogeneity in the risk of such recurrent events can provide valuable scientific insight for guiding customized disease management In this paper  we propose a new sensible measure of individual risk of recurrent events and present a dynamic modeling framework thereof  which accounts for both observed covariates and unobservable frailty The proposed modeling requires no distributional specification of the unobservable frailty  while permitting the exploration of dynamic effects of the observed covari ates We develop estimation and inference procedures for the proposed model through a novel adaptation of the principle of conditional score The asymptotic

But  alas  that is not the complete picture: machines are easily fooled too. With some clever tricks  any picture of a lion can easily be manipulated in such a way that humans do not notice any difference  but that the machine learning model sees a completely different animal. Such a manipulated image is called an adversarial example.What is going on there? Have we built the most powerful machine learning models ever on brittle foundations?  The above is an example of adversarial learning  a subfield of machine learning that is concerned with what happens when we fool a machine learning model and how we can prevent and/or exploit this. While the first example here is mostly concerned with issues  an example of exploitation is found in the class of machine learning models called generative adversarial networks. Ever since the dawn of generative adversarial networks  the field of generative machine learning has taken multiple leaps forward and has paved the way to application domains we couldn’t even think of before. When training generative adversarial networks  we let two machines play a game against each other: one machine gradually tries to become a master painter  while the other machine is the art critic that gets better and better at discerning genuine paintings from counterfeits. By making the painter try to fool the critic over and over again  the painter becomes more skilled and will produce more realistic paintings.

Description This course aims to provide insight into basic statistical concepts with emphasis on practical applications. Mathematical formulae will be kept to a minimum. The theory and the methods of analysis will be extensively illustrated with examples relating to a wide variety of different fields. To emphasize the practical approach in this course all classes will take place in a pc room. The practical part of the first session (after the break) will be dedicated to getting to know the software package R. Participants are encouraged to participate in both parts. We start with concise graphical and numerical descriptions of data obtained from observational or experimental studies. The most common and frequently used probability distributions of discrete and continuous variables will be presented. Statistical inference draws conclusions about a population based on sampled data. Chance variations are taken into account such that a level of confidence is attached to these conclusions. We present the reasoning behind significance tests for the comparison of observed data with a hypothesis  the validity of which we want to assess. We apply this procedure to data obtained either from one or from two populations. The correct use of the t-test will be discussed. Nonparametric methods are considered as a possible alternative in case the requirements of the t-test are not met. We cover the basic concepts of hypothesis testing for categorical data  including the chi-square test. Quite often the relationship between two variables  where the outcome of one variable is seen as depending on the value of the other  is the focus of scientific interest. We will give an introduction to linear regression analysis  where a regression line based on observations obtained in a sample describes this relation. Hands-on exercises are worked out behind the PC using the R software. Target audience This course will benefit professionals and investigators from diverse areas  research scientists  clinical research associates  investing in data handling and wishing to acquire insight into basic statistical methods or to refresh their knowledge and practice of statistics.

Especially  we do not fully understand how ethical perceptions about AI influence both job applicants and the organizations that use AI for hiring purposes. In this session  we will discuss important aspects of using AI in hiring processes. First  we will discuss that AI is not created equally in terms of ethical perceptions. Indeed  people view the use of AI differently depending on what aspects of the hiring process it is used for (e.g.  analyzing CV vs. analyzing one’s social media). Then  we will discuss the influence of ethical perceptions of AI in hiring on the trust individuals put in organizations that use AI in hiring. We will focus on the importance individuals lend to AI performing its expected role  and how this expectation influences their ethical perceptions of AI  and in turn the trust they put on organizations using AI in hiring. Finally  we will further discuss whether and how ethical perceptions of using AI in hiring are related to individuals’ attraction to organizations that use AI in hiring. Circling back to the beginning of the session  we will discuss that the influence of ethical perceptions of using AI in hiring are not consistent across hiring methods. For example  only individuals who consider it ethical for organizations to use AI in intrusive ways  such as analyzing social media information for traits and characteristics  viewed such organizations as more attractive. ', 'data': 'Ethical Perceptions of AI How Does it Matter for Hiring  Abstract of the lecture  The use of Artificial Intelligence AI entails enormous ethical challenges Especially  we do not fully understand how ethical perceptions about AI influence both job applicants and the organizations that use AI for hiring purposes In this session  we will discuss important aspects of using AI in hiring processes First  we will discuss that AI is not created equally in terms of ethical perceptions Indeed  people view the use of AI differently depending on what aspects of the hiring process it is used for eg  analyzing CV vs analyzing one’s social media Then  we will discuss the influence of ethical perceptions of AI in hiring on the trust individuals put in organizations that use AI in hiring We will focus on the importance individuals lend to AI performing its expected role  and how this expectation influences their ethical perceptions of AI  and in turn the trust they put on organizations using AI in hiring Finally  we will further discuss whether and how ethical perceptions of using AI in hiring are related to individuals’ attraction to organizations that use AI in hiring Circling back to the beginning of the session  we will discuss that the influence of ethical perceptions of using AI in hiring are not consistent across hiring methods For example  only individuals who consider it ethical for organizations to use AI in intrusive ways  such as analyzing social media information for traits and characteristics  viewed such organizations as more attractive  More info  Share this course   httpswwwvubbeeneventethicalperceptionsaihowdoesitmatterforhiring 26 Oct 2023 1400  1600 LectureBrusselVUB', 'skills': \"['Artificial Intelligence']\"}, {'title': 'Design and Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials', 'url': 'https://www.vaia.be/en/courses/design-and-analysis-of-randomized-clinical-trials', 'date': '25/10/2023', 'course_info': 'microcredential-Ghent-UGent', 'start_time': '25 Oct 2023 - 13 Dec 2023', 'language': 'English', 'location_detail': 'Krijgslaan 281, 9000 Gent', 'target_group': 'Target audience: This course is aimed at biologists, bioinformaticians and statisticians interested in analysing single-cell RNA-seq datasets.', 'subscription_limit': 'NA', 'constraints': 'The basics of statistical concepts, techniques and inference, knowledge of linear regression and categorical data analysis are considered known.', 'price': '€890', 'details': 'https://beta-academy.ugent.be/en/program/micro-credentials/2022-2023-2023-2024-mc-da23-24-m2-micro-credential-design-and-analysis-of', 'sub_title': 'Design and Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials', 'intro': 'Understanding of statistical principles, methodology and concepts involved in clinical research across the various phases', 'full_body': \"   Understanding of statistical principles  methodology and concepts involved in clinical research across the various phases                               In a rapidly changing (professional) context  lifelong learning has become a must.

Description R is a flexible environment for statistical computing and graphics  which is becoming increasingly popular as a tool to get insight in often complex data. While in some ways similar to other programming languages (such as C  Java and Perl)  R is particularly suited for data analysis because ready-made functions are available for a wide variety of statistical (classical statistical tests  linear and nonlinear modeling  timeseries analysis  classification  clustering  ...) and graphical techniques. The base R program can be extended with user-submitted packages  which means new techniques are often implemented in R before being available in other software. This is one of the reasons why R is becoming the de facto standard in certain fields such as bioinformatics (Bioconductor) and financial services. This course introduces the use of the R environment for the implementation of data management  data exploration  basic statistical analysis and automation of procedures. It starts with a description of the R GUI  the use of the command line and an overview of basic data structures. The application of standard procedures to import data or to export results to external files will be illustrated. Creation of new variables  subsetting  merging and stacking of data sets will be covered in the data management section. Exploration of the data by histograms  box plots  scatter plots  summary numbers  correlation coefficients and cross-tabulations will be performed. Simple statistical procedures that will be covered are: comparisons of observed group means (t-test  ANOVA and their non-parametric versions) and proportionstest for independence in 2-way cross tables and linear regression (focusing on the R-implementation of the statistical methods that are the subject of other modules of the statistics series)Finally  installing new packages and automation of analysis procedures will also be discussed. Practical sessions and specific exercises will be provided to allow participants to practice their R skills in interaction with the teacher. Target audience This course targets professionals and investigators from diverse areas with little to no R-programming experience who wish to start using R for their data manipulation  data exploration or statistical analysis.

The name comes from an acronym for BOunded HEight Matrices  of Integers  although the restriction to integers has been subsequently relaxed. The “height” of a vector is its infinity norm  and the “height” of a matrix A is the infinity norm of vec(A). The word “height” has been commonly used in the context of univariate polynomials expressed in the monomial basis: the height of a polynomial is the infinity norm of the vector of coefficients. We say “characteristic height” for the height of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix A. The idea is to restrict the study to families of matrices all of whose entries come from a finite (and hence bounded) set  called the population. Well-known examples include zero-one or binary matrices  Bernoulli matrices whose entries are either 1 or -1  and sign pattern matrices where the entries can be 1  0  or -1. One can then study Bohemian families of structured matrices  say upper Hessenberg Toeplitz Bohemian matrices  or complex symmetric tridiagonal Bohemian matrices  or symmetric matrices with entries from a restricted population  or Bohemian companion matrices  or other families. In this talk I will survey some known results  and discuss some problems that remain open. In particular  I will ask for help in finding algorithms to construct “minimal height” companion matrices for polynomials with integer coefficients; such things exist (possibly not uniquely) but there is no known good algorithm for constructing them. I will give examples where the height of the companion matrix is exponentially smaller (in the degree/dimension) than is the characteristic height. This seems interesting because lower height offers the hope of better eigenvalue conditioning. But even that is not well-understood. This is joint work with many people.

Authors of accepted abstracts will have the opportunity to submit a full paper after the conference to CLIN Journal. CLIN33 organizes a shared task on the Automatic Detection of AI-Generated Texts. With the surge of powerful automatic content generation comes the important task of distinguishing texts generated by language models from texts written by humans. Therefore  the CLIN33 shared task invites you to contribute to the development of automatic detection systems of AI-generated texts. The shared task consists of two tracks.  Visit the shared task website for more information Detection Track In this track you will develop a system that detects whether a document is generated by a language model or written by a human. The system will be evaluated on a test dataset that will remain hidden. For tuning your system you will be provided with a sample of the test data as a development set. Your system will be submitted as a notebook (colab or jupyter) and be self-containedThe test data will not be sharedYou will be provided with a subset of the test data for validation and developmentNo training data will be provided  you are expected to create your own when using Machine LearningThere will be a scoreboard for testing your model on the validation data that you can use to monitor progress during developmentThere will be three genres of text: newspaper text  tweets  and poemsThe text will be generated by different language models (we will provide information about which models later)The generated text will be produced using different prompt engineering strategies (standard  academic level  middle school level  human-like  ...)There will be an English and a Dutch subtrack. Participants are expected to participate in both. There will be a prize for the team that develops the best performing system averaged over both languages and all conditions. Explanation Track (optional) In this track  you will provide a qualitative analysis  empirically supported by the output of your system on the validation set  of the knowledge used by your model to solve the task. This explanation can be in terms of statistical properties or in terms of linguistic patterns and phenomena and will the form of a short paper (4 pages max). This track will be evaluated by the organizers  extended with additional judges representing the users of detection systems (for example teachers or editors).

We will then use these keystroke logging files to learn the basic technologies involved in making a (genetic) digital edition. As a first step  we will encode all the textual operations (e.g.  new text production  additions  deletions) in TEI-XML together with the timestamps of each operation. These XML files will be used the next day as we move on to the visualisation of the reconstructions of the digital writing processes. THURSDAY | eXist-db eXist-db app  HTML  CSS On the fourth day  we will learn the basics of working with eXist-db.

In this work  we present an overview of the three main compression methods (pruning  quantization  knowledge distillation) that allow to reduce the computation time and memory size of DNN models while keeping a high accuracy. Experimental results are conducted within image classification  object detection and actions recognition with DNN models that were optimized and deployed on Edge AI resources such as Jetson Nano  Jetson Xavier and Jetson Orin. The obtained results showed that we could reach a compression factor of around 6x while keeping a good accuracy  and we also observe a speedup of 3x compared to non-compressed models.

Krzysztof Dembczyński — Yahoo! Research  USA aned Poznań University of Technology  Poland) We consider a problem of optimizing macro-averaged complex performance metrics in multi-label classification  that is metrics linearly decomposable into a sum of binary classification utilities applied separately to each label. We focus on tasks in which the algorithm is required to predict exactly k labels for each instance  leading to macro-at-k metrics. The constraint couples the otherwise independent binary classification tasks  leading to a much more challenging optimization problem than standard macro-averages. We analyze the problem in two different statistical regimes  namely in the expected test utility (ETU) and the population utility (PU) frameworks. The former aims at optimizing the expected performance on a given test set  while the latter optimizes the performance on a population level. For both frameworks we derive optimal prediction rules and practical algorithmic solutions with provable statistical guarantees. Empirical results provide evidence for the competitive performance of the proposed approaches.   13:40 - 14:20 On extensions of loss minimisation for training uncertainty-aware predictors (Prof. dr. Eyke Hüllermeier — LMU Munich  Germany) Due to the steadily increasing relevance of machine learning for practical applications  many of which are coming with safety requirements  the notion of uncertainty has received increasing attention in machine learning research in the recent past. This talk will address questions and challenges regarding the representation and adequate handling of (predictive) uncertainty in (supervised) machine learning. A specific focus will be put on the distinction between two important types of uncertainty  often referred to as aleatoric and epistemic. In this regard  a recent generalisation of the common (empirical) loss minimisation approach in machine learning will be critically anaysed and shown to be fundamentally flawed.   14:20 - 15:00 Learning from user and environment in combinatorial optimisation (Prof. dr. ir. Tias Guns — KU Leuven  Belgium) Industry and society are increasingly automating processes  which requires solving combinatorial optimisation problems. To find not just optimal solutions  but also 'desirable' solutions for the end user  it is increasingly important to offer AI tools that automatically learn from the user and the environment and that support the constraint modelling in interpretable ways. In this talk I will provide an overview of three different ways in which AI can augment the modeling part of combinatorial optimisation. This includes learning from the user (preference learning in VRP)  learning from the environment (end-to-end decision focussed learning) and explanation generation  that sit at the intersection of learning and reasoning. As part of this work  we are building a modern constraint programming language called CPMpy(http://cpmpy.readthedocs.io) that eases integration of multiple constraint solving paradigms with machine learning and other scientific python libraries. I will shortly highlight its possibilities beyond the above cases  as well as our larger vision of conversational human-aware technology for optimisation.   16:00 - 18:00 Efficient algorithms for set-valued prediction in classification (Public PhD defence ir. Thomas Mortier — Ghent University)  In recent years  the use of machine learning has gained popularity in solving complex tasks across multiple domains  including robotics  healthcare  biology and finance. However  with the increasing amount of data and complexity of tasks  the notion of uncertainty has become of major importance in machine learning. The ability to represent uncertainty in an efficient and trustworthy way should therefore be considered as a key feature of any machine learning method. This thesis aims to address this challenge by focusing on the development of principled tools to efficiently represent uncertainty in machine learning. In particular  the concept of set-valued prediction is highlighted  which provides end-users with multiple answers instead of a single answer with little guarantee. To this end  probabilistic classification is considered  where the unknown relationship between inputs and classes is assumed to be non-deterministic and expressed by a conditional class distribution. A distinction between several settings in classification is made and different biological applications are considered  including large-scale bacterial species identification using Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) data. \", 'data': 'Optimisation in Machine Learning  1300  1340 Optimization of macroatk metrics in multilabel
