        "A NoCode Approach to Decision Support and Knowledge Capturing  In their daytoday operations  companies typically make many small but important decisions  such as  which employee should handle an incoming requestwhich service should be recommended to a specific customerhow should a specific product be configured to meet a customers requirement whether a specific customer is entitled to a discount  etc  Decision  support systems can help employees make these decisions faster  more  reliably and more consistently  reducing costs and increasing confidence  in the process To develop such systems  blackbox AI methods such as  deep learning are not wellsuited  because they lack the required  transparency and explainability A more promising approach are  knowledgebased AI systems  which derive their intelligence not from  data  but from logical models of rules  regulations and expert  knowledge In this workshop  you will get to know the  stateoftheart IDP knowledgebase system  developed at KU Leuven It  is currently being used by companies in the manufacturing httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkpPe0GRjifE  financial httpsyoutubeZzsy4MtdWBE  and legal sectors to provide various decision support  both to their  customers and inhouse This system is based on methods and techniques  that were developed for declarative programming systems such as Prolog   but it offers a number of important innovations 1 instead of focusing  only on querying  the IDP system provides a wide range of different  functionalities that can be used to implement rich interactive  interfaces that support users in different workflows  2 instead of  relying on programmers  the system allows its end users to maintain the  underlying knowledge base  which means that we can cut out the middle  man of IT staff and allow the business experts themselves to update the  system  thereby not only reducing cost and turnaround time but also  putting the ownership of the decision knowledge in the right hands The  workshop starts with a brief introduction to Knowledgebased AI and  presents existing applications in the financial and manufacturing  sectors We then proceed with a handson tutorial  using a freely  available web interface that participants access from their own laptops  In this workshop you will get to know the stateoftheart IDP  knowledgebase system that has been developed at KU Leuven and is  currently used by companies in various sectors You will be able to build basic applications using IDP and you will be able to identify potential use cases for this technology httpspuckuleuvenbenlopleiding6kjpeqerb3gbx7zo Workshop workshopBruggeKU Leuven Postuniversitair Centrum VAIA\r",
