        "A NoCode Approach to Decision Support and Knowledge Capturing  In their daytoday operations  companies typically make many small but important decisions  such as  which employee should handle an incoming requestwhich service should be recommended to a specific customerhow should a specific product be configured to meet a customers requirement whether a specific customer is entitled to a discount  etc  Decision  support systems can help employees make these decisions faster  more  reliably and more consistently  reducing costs and increasing confidence  in the process To develop such systems  blackbox AI methods such as  deep learning are not wellsuited  because they lack the required  transparency and explainability A more promising approach are  knowledgebased AI systems  which derive their intelligence not from  data  but from logical models of rules  regulations and expert  knowledge In this workshop  you will get to know the  stateoftheart IDP knowledgebase system  developed at KU Leuven It  is currently being used by companies in the manufacturing httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkpPe0GRjifE  financial httpsyoutubeZzsy4MtdWBE  and legal sectors to provide various decision support  both to their  customers and inhouse This system is based on methods and techniques  that were developed for declarative programming systems such as Prolog   but it offers a number of important innovations 1 instead of focusing  only on querying  the IDP system provides a wide range of different  functionalities that can be used to implement rich interactive  interfaces that support users in different workflows  2 instead of  relying on programmers  the system allows its end users to maintain the  underlying knowledge base  which means that we can cut out the middle  man of IT staff and allow the business experts themselves to update the  system  thereby not only reducing cost and turnaround time but also  putting the ownership of the decision knowledge in the right hands The  workshop starts with a brief introduction to Knowledgebased AI and  presents existing applications in the financial and manufacturing  sectors We then proceed with a handson tutorial  using a freely  available web interface that participants access from their own laptops  In this workshop you will get to know the stateoftheart IDP  knowledgebase system that has been developed at KU Leuven and is  currently used by companies in various sectors You will be able to build basic applications using IDP and you will be able to identify potential use cases for this technology httpspuckuleuvenbenlopleiding6kjpeqerb3gbx7zo Workshop workshopBruggeKU Leuven Postuniversitair Centrum VAIA\r",

        "A new symbolicnumeric method to solve the multiparameter eigenvalue problem  In this talk  we focus on polynomial systems coming from the multiparameter eigenvalue problem and certain generalizations Using the theory of resultants and Weyman complexes  we present new matrices of optimal size for solving these systems This talk is based on joint work with Jean Charles Faug\ufffdre  Angelos Mantzaflaris  and Elias Tsigaridas  A classical approach to solving polynomial systems is to linearize the problem and reduce it to an eigenvalue calculation For this purpose certain families of special matrices are used eg Sylvester and Dixon matrices Their size and structure determine how far these methods can go therefore it is essential to construct better matrices for the specific systems that arise in practice  httpshomesesatkuleuvenbesistawwwbdmbacktotherootsindexphpseminars Seminar by Mat\ufffdas R Bender CMAP \ufffdcole Polytechnique seminarHeverlee LeuvenKU Leuven ESAT STADIUS\r",

        "KG3D Learning and Reasoning Webinar  by Simon Vandevelde Operational decisions are an important part of knowledgeintensive organizations  as these are taken in a high volume on a daily basis However  describing these decisions in a standardized format such as DMN is a timeconsuming task  as various textual sources need to be analyzed In this talk  we present the results of our experiments on an automated approach to generating decision tables from natural language based on the GPT3 LLM Through a total of 72 experiments over six problem descriptions  we evaluated GPT3's decision logic modeling and reasoning capabilities While GPT3 demonstrates promising abilities in extracting decision context and identifying relevant variables from natural language  further enhancements are needed to improve its decision table capabilities for efficient automation of DMN modeling by Ioannis Dasoulas An abundance of tabular data exists and is used by a wide range of applications However  a big portion of these data lack the semantic information necessary for users and machines to properly understand them This lack of table semantic understanding impedes their usage in data analytics pipelines Existing solutions are focused on specific annotation tasks and types of tables  and rely solely on large knowledge bases  making it difficult to reuse in realworld settings In this talk  we present TorchicTab  aversatile semantic table interpretation system able to annotate tables with varied structures by using either an external knowledge graph  such as Wikidata  or annotated tables with predefined terms for training The results demonstrate TorchicTab's ability to produce accurate annotations for different tasks across varied datasets  More info  Share this course   httpskg3dcskuleuvenbeevents 26 Feb 2024 0900  1015 webinaronlineKG3D KU Leuven\r",
