        "A new symbolicnumeric method to solve the multiparameter eigenvalue problem  In this talk  we focus on polynomial systems coming from the multiparameter eigenvalue problem and certain generalizations Using the theory of resultants and Weyman complexes  we present new matrices of optimal size for solving these systems This talk is based on joint work with Jean Charles Faug\ufffdre  Angelos Mantzaflaris  and Elias Tsigaridas  A classical approach to solving polynomial systems is to linearize the problem and reduce it to an eigenvalue calculation For this purpose certain families of special matrices are used eg Sylvester and Dixon matrices Their size and structure determine how far these methods can go therefore it is essential to construct better matrices for the specific systems that arise in practice  httpshomesesatkuleuvenbesistawwwbdmbacktotherootsindexphpseminars Seminar by Mat\ufffdas R Bender CMAP \ufffdcole Polytechnique seminarHeverlee LeuvenKU Leuven ESAT STADIUS\r",

        "KG3D Learning and Reasoning Webinar  by Simon Vandevelde Operational decisions are an important part of knowledgeintensive organizations  as these are taken in a high volume on a daily basis However  describing these decisions in a standardized format such as DMN is a timeconsuming task  as various textual sources need to be analyzed In this talk  we present the results of our experiments on an automated approach to generating decision tables from natural language based on the GPT3 LLM Through a total of 72 experiments over six problem descriptions  we evaluated GPT3's decision logic modeling and reasoning capabilities While GPT3 demonstrates promising abilities in extracting decision context and identifying relevant variables from natural language  further enhancements are needed to improve its decision table capabilities for efficient automation of DMN modeling by Ioannis Dasoulas An abundance of tabular data exists and is used by a wide range of applications However  a big portion of these data lack the semantic information necessary for users and machines to properly understand them This lack of table semantic understanding impedes their usage in data analytics pipelines Existing solutions are focused on specific annotation tasks and types of tables  and rely solely on large knowledge bases  making it difficult to reuse in realworld settings In this talk  we present TorchicTab  aversatile semantic table interpretation system able to annotate tables with varied structures by using either an external knowledge graph  such as Wikidata  or annotated tables with predefined terms for training The results demonstrate TorchicTab's ability to produce accurate annotations for different tasks across varied datasets  More info  Share this course   httpskg3dcskuleuvenbeevents 26 Feb 2024 0900  1015 webinaronlineKG3D KU Leuven\r",
