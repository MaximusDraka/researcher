        "ChatGPT and Co in higher education to be cheered or feared    Artificial Intelligence takes many forms One of those of widest  relevance for our universities is the passionately discussed chatbot  application ChatGPT  launched in November 2022 by OpenAI In a matter of  seconds  it can produce texts that sound like wellinformed answers to  any possible question  react to users' objections and summarize long  texts Its potential is evident in many fields  including all aspects of  university life    But it also constitutes  along with related AI applications  a  formidable challenge  not least for the way we teach and evaluate our  students The texts ChatGPT generates  whether concise or richly  developed  often seem to provide students with all they need to perform  many tasks currently assigned to them as homework  tests or exams  Should we regulate  restrict or even forbid their use of ChatGPT    Should we on the contrary encourage our students to use it and  radically redesign how we evaluate them Should we even rethink in depth  what we need to teach them why bother trying to teach them to write  texts in their own and other languages if ChatGPT can do that far better  for them Should we concentrate instead on teaching our students  critical thinking skills    Or should we rather be primarily worried about the unwarranted trust  which our students will unavoidably nourish for ChatGPT's answers  or  about the many biases that affect unwittingly the information that is  reaching them  or about the huge ecological cost of the worldwide  operation of AI applications  Organizing committee  P Van Parijs coordinator  JM Chaumont  E De Keuleneer  MC de Marneffe  B De Munck   H Garmyn  P Goethals  JP Lambert  Q Michel  B Seghers  D Willems  J Willems  The potential of artificial intelligence applications like ChatGPT is evident in many fields including all aspects of university life but it also constitutes a formidable challenge not least for the way we teach and evaluate our students Should we encourage our students to use it and radically redesign how we evaluate them Or should we rather be worried about the unwarranted trust in it or about the many biases that affect the information that is reaching them httpswwwethicalforumbe Should academics fear or cheer ChatGPT and its cognates seminarBrusselsKU Leuven UGent UCLL Ethical Forum\r",

Computing area  Software Development Experiences  Professional As the Principal Software Engineer I have developed custom AutoCAD palettes using AutoCAD NET API for Virtual Forward Operating Base VFOB  The palette holds the different blocks that may be dragged and dropped onto the AutoCAD drawing canvas  DCAM As the Principal Software Engineer I have redesigned restructured and developed the Detailed Component Analysis Module DCAM of the VFOB software  The original DCAM was developed using monolithic ad hoc structure  I have redesigned the module by adopting objectoriented paradigm  LCM As the Primary Responsible Engineer I have developed a software module for sensor data analysis and prediction to support the unified building information modeling BIM framework for sustainable missionready facilities  The BIM framework provides a facility control lifecycle model that allows comparison between expected and actual facility usage and detect any usage anomalies thereof  The developed software implements a Cluster Analysis algorithm for comparing and identifying patterns in historical sensor data  It also implements the Fast Fourier Transformation FFT for noise reduction in the data  As the Primary Responsible Engineer I have designed developed and successfully released the V51V52 V Interfaces at the digital Local Exchange to support Access Networks protocol software product  I have used C and C for development  I have tested and validated the V51V52 product for quality acceptance and conformance to the ITUT standards  I used proprietary scripting language for testing conformance  I have provided postrelease maintenance bug discovery patch generation etc and customer support  The product is used to establish maintain and control communication between telephone Access Networks and Local Exchanges  The corresponding specifications describe both OSI layer 3 network layer and 2 data link layer protocols  Both protocol software products were developed during the same product lifecycle  As the Primary Responsible Engineer I have reengineered and modified the LAPD Link Access Procedure for ISDN Dchannels and SAAL Signaling ATM Adaptation Layer protocol software source codes to upgrade the products from dysfunctional code bases and released them as fullfeatured and stable products resulting in an overall increase of more than 50 in sales for both products  I used C and C languages  I have modified LAPD and SAAL source code to support their use in FaultTolerantHigh Availability architecture include provision of runtime debug control and make extension of the products management interface controls  I have tested and validated the LAPD and SAAL products for quality acceptance and conformance to the ITUT standards  I have provided postrelease maintenance bug discovery patch generation etc and customer support to LAPD and SAAL customers  Software Development Experiences  Research As a research assistant at the Mississippi State University I have developed a resource management system for adaptive parallel applications for LINUX cluster environments using C TCPIP Sockets the POSIX thread library and the C Standard Template Library  Designed and developed a LINUX based NIC module for the Myrinet programmable M3MPCI64B NIC and the embedded Myrinet Control Program MCP for the LANai 9 RISC processor of the NIC  The MCP is developed using the LANai Tools version 295216  Software Development Experiences  Academic Developed a LINUX kernel module for driving the Standard Microsystems Corporation LAN83C171 Ethernet card
