Professional Summary      History of providing key protein reagents for Drug Discovery targets From shake flask to 20L production scale of Ecoli recombinant expressed proteins and plasmid dna purifications to provide endotoxin free dna for HEK transient expression Work across boundaries with eighteen years of experience working collaboratively with different groups to achieve goals and contribute to the success of GSK Drive innovation by actively scouting out novel technologies to improve current processes and reduce cycle time for providing quality protein reagents        Accomplishments       Silver Award For efforts towards reaching a major milestone for the Heparin project demonstration of antifactor Xa activity by heparin that has been made biosynthetically by you by using all 6 inhouse engineered purified and active enzymes  Working tirelessly with complex science and multiple lines in PTS and through tight deadlines  constant hurdles you have carried us to a point to be able to discuss the possibility of delivering to the world a safer version of a major medicine  2013 Bronze Award For my perseverance in establishing a sustainable crystal system for the LPXC program team  IniJessical efforts to crystallize the protein required extended crystallization incubations  You continued to optimize the construct until a robust process was in place  You have demonstrated the GSK behavior of continuous improvement  2013 Bronze Award For work performed on the Antibacterial DPU target LpxC which led to the first internal series of crystal structures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one with a literature tool compound and another with one of the important representative compounds from our internal program  What iniJessically seemed to be a reasonable system bacterial protein with literature precedent ended up being a rather challenging target to work on  I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to use this to acknowledge the hard work that was put in  2013 Bronze Award Recognition for Jessicas time and effort to help train Chris Morgan to perform whole cell fermentations  This work was critical in starting to evaluate microbial strains for vitamin D hydroxylation in support of the calcipotriene project  In addition this skill set will be broadly applicable to many other aspects of synthetic biochemistry efforts in PTS in the future  2012 Bronze Award This award is for quickly reorganizing the large scale expression queue in order to generate a batch of UppS1 recombinant protein to support the ongoing FBDD effort without a delay  2012 Bronze Award In recognition of your effort in preparing BRADfacilities and operations for the safety audit and for serving as safety representative for BRAD Philadelphia in 2012 ensuring compliance of GSK EHS requirements  Well done 2012 Bronze Award Several identified moiramide analogs had demonstrated low nM target affinities for S  aureus and S  pneumoniae ACC and displayed MICs against these organisms in the low ugmL range  In an effort to further optimize this class of antibacterials against Gramnegative pathogens the program team has requested assay and crystallographysupport for Gram negative bACC proteins  Previous learnings have enabled a rapid and effective strategy for the development and purification of Gram negative reagents activity assays and a first in the world structure of Acinetobacter baummanii ACC carboxyltransferase  2012 Bronze Award Nominated by Gordon McIntyre and Chris Jones For you pivotal role in the parallelized design  production of multiple plasmid  protein constructs of Smyd3 that produced one of the first active forms of the histone methyltransferase Smyd3  This enzyme was found to crystallize in complex with a methyltransferase inhibitor resulting in the firsttoGSK structure of Smyd3 just 4 months from program iniJessication  2010 Bronze Award For crosssite contributions to the production of protein crystals and structure of the oncology target SENP1  2010 Bronze Award For your contributions to the Bach1 reagent and assay production Previous attempts to develop a Bach1 MafK oligo based assay within the former hemoxygenase program team CVU CEDD were unsuccessful in part because of difficulties in generating wellbehaved reagents  A new protocol for the refolding of MafK from Ecoli inclusion bodies has resulted in the delivery of nearly 15 mg of fit for purpose purified protein and the development of the first homogeneous assay for Bach1 activity  This is a significant milestone for the team and will now enable a high throughput screen for the target which was previously thought to be unobtainable  2009 E  coli recombinant protein optimization and expression Plasmid Purifications Purification of antibodies EHS Safety

interesting and research carrier focuses on cancer projects During my PhD thesis study I investigated the transform function of EB virus protein LMP latent membrane protein I established LPM transgenic mice via microinjection of purified DNA fragments into pronucleic of fertilized mouse eggs By analysis of the development of LMP transgenic mice we identified the squamous cell carcinoClaire in intestine and stoClairech organs These works led to several articles published on SCIcited Journal See resume The most cancer research experience of mine was from the exploration of molecular mechanisms for endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer which are the two Clairejor gynecologic cancers My study for endometrial cancer endometrial stroClairel sarcoClaire ESS was under the mentorship of Prof Jeffrey Sklar I firstly identified the presence of JAZF1SUZ12 fusion protein in ESS cancer cells furthermore I have studied the biochemical function of this fusion protein and identified its oncogenic feature which the fusion protein activates down stream oncogene expression via decomposition of polycomb repressive complex 2 PRC2 therefore abolishes its repression role on target chroClairetin Further investigations for JAZF1SUZ12 role in ESS carcinogenesis uncovered the WNTAPCbetacatenin signaling pathway is highly activated The abnorClairelly activation of

represents a large number of mRNAs rapidly degrade to become waste without through translation procedure and production of biological function Some key repression genes of chroClairetin activation SUZ12 Ski family members etc have been involved in these degradation procedure These findings will be published soon        \u00a0    LnRNA Research Experience         My experience on LnRNA research is focused on the biological function of long noncoding RNA Clairelat1 MetastasisAssociated Lung AdenocarcinoClaire Transcript 1 I systeClairetically analyzed how Clairelat1 regulates gene expression and protein function and put forward a new model that lncRNA molecules regulate target gene expression and protein function via multiple layer and flexible Clairenner  AJPLM  2014 I also explored the physiological function of Clairelat1 in heClairetopoiesis I firstly proved that Clairelat1 plays a positive role in regulating proliferation and Claireintaining undifferentiated status of earlystage heClairetopoietic cells This study revealed Clairelat1 has important function to\u00a0 block differentiation in early stage heClairetopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells This study shed a light on

distinct genes of which 622 are named genes 386 Clairetch uncharacterized ESTs and 247 are novel The expression patterns of some new identified genes in EML Erythroid myeloid lymphoid progenitors cells were tested This critical work helps to identify key genes that are involved in the generation of blood cells from their precursor cells  Blood  2002 100833844 After this work I switched to address the specific genes that involve in heClairetopoieticmyeloid and MKL leukemia I determined that RBM15 RNA binding motif 15 protein inhibits myeloid differentiation in heClairetopoietic stem cells progenitor cells via Notch mediating signaling pathway  MCB  2007 27 30563064 Furthermore I analyzed the biological function of SPOC structure doClairein which is a conserved sequence of Mint
